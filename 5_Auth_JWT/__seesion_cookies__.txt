=====================================================
authentication can be : 
1] JWT-stateless  : if no session is stored in server
  Ex. if only jwt is verified for authentication

2] Session-statefull : if session is stored in backend

IMP: When using a session store, such as Redis, 
the actual session data is stored on the server, 
and only a session identifier (usually a unique ID) 
is sent to the client as a cookie. 
  
Session = cookie + sessionID (unique)

in browser = set-header : { sessionID : cookie }

cookie contains encrypted data which only be 
decrypted using session secret
- on the server side if it is not decrypted it is 
inavalid session

 Ex. with every request cookies are sent which 
   contains session data and this session has Id
   i.e. sessionID using this user is validated and
   identified and his history is taken from session
  General process for Session :
    //The session data is typically stored 
    in the session store, such as Redis, 
    at the end of the request lifecycle

    // general process: 
  
   1] create session (cookie + userData ) and Attach to 
   REQUEST object not to RESPONSE object
  [ session = cookie + session data (can user data)]
  [ cookie = conatins sessionID and some other data ]
  - cookie is encrypted using session secret
  - add cookie to session with unique sessionID
  - at the end of request add session to storage
  - only COOKIE will be sent to client
  in RESPONSE header : set-cookie: { sessionID: cookie }

  2] client sends Back cookie in cookie header
  - 1) take cookie from header and 
      decrypt cookie using session secret
  - 2) search for session in redis using sessionID from cookie
  - 3) Attach session data from redis to REQUEST object
  - 4) as session conatins some user relead data use it 
       to perform user Specific tasks
  - 5) send RESPONSE
=========================================================
--------- session ---------
- stored on server side
- sent with every request
- has uniques sessionID used for authentication of user
 how? check session present in backend db  
- stored in cookies on client side
- sent with each request to server
- sessionID is just a string
- session contains token

--------- cookies ---------
-cookie is header just  like authorization or content-type
- Set-Header 
- signed with secret 
- can be encrypted
- url encoded : not for security but compat
- conatins sessionID token
- attributes : 1) Domain 2) Path 3) Expiration
-flags : 1) HttpOnly(can not read with js on browser) 
         2) secure(HTTPS only i.e only can be sent on TLS channel)
         3) SameSite (no CORS)

- CSRF Attack : Croos-site Resource Forgery
    - isme CSRF token bheja jata hai jo X-CSRF-TOKEN cookie header me 
    original cookie k sath bheja jata hai

==================TOKEN based auth (stateless approach )===============
- tokens are not stored on server side only stored on client side
- ( sessions are stored on server side)
- signed with secret
- sent in Authorization header
-  XSS Attack may become easy
- used Web app, mobile apps
1) user logs in and token is generated and sent to client 
2) client stores token in storage and send with each request to server
3) server verifies token and grants access
4) if log out token is cleared from client storage (Ex. browser storage)

====== local Storage =====

- permenant
- different for each site so no other site can access
  i.e. Domain-Specific
- size 5MB > 4Kb cookie size
- Cons:
  - format plain text
  - limited to string format need to serialize to work with json
  - any JS code can read data so XSS Attack  is easy
   so can steal tokens

===== Session Storage =====
- cleared when page is loaded
