## Terms:

### API keys:
In AWS API Gateway, API keys are used to `control and track acces`s to your APIsâ€”especially when:

- You want to `limit` who can access your APIs.
- You want to `monitor` usage per client (e.g., for rate limiting, throttling, analytics).
- You want to `associate usage plans` with different API consumers.
