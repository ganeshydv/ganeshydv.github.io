## Threads: User Thread || Demon Thread
- set: thread.isDemon(true);
-  `Alive until Main thread is Alive`
- Garbage Collector: Demon Thread
- in logging can be useful

## Types of Lock

1. Monitor Lock 
   - synchronized
   - depends on object(this)
### Custom Locks: Not depend on object (No synchronized)
   - why?
       - In Monitor lock rsource object is shared among thread but what if there are muliple threads with having same or different monitor object then this lock will not make any method to be accessed by single thread
       - in this scenario even if there are different instance objects (monitor) of same type it should not let access of particular code segment to any thread
       - EX. database connection limit is 5 so if 10 threads want to access them it should wait 
2. Reentrant 
3. ReadWrite
4. semaphore
5. Stamped
### 1. Reentrant Lock
- Used directly 
```java
class SharedProductResource{
    boolean isAvailable;
    ReentrantLock lock=new ReentrantLock();
    void producer(){
        
    }

}
```
