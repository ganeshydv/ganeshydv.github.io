# How Java Memory allocation works?

## Run Cmd: javac example.java
- converts to bytecode : example.class
## Run Cmd: Java example.class 
### 1. JDK: will Allocate HEAP memory for JVM Process
### 2. JDK: will start new JVM instance
### 3. JVM: `JIT`: will `Converts` `bytecode` to `machine code`

- when JIT convert to machine code it check for if new thread will be required based on code and if yes then it creates new thread with Stack + Register + counter
- Main thing about JIT is this converting and creating thread can haapen at run time or compile time

### 4. JVM: `Code Segment` [`Code Cache`]  = `JIT`: will `save` `machine code` in `Code Segment` 
- this is read only : cpu can understand
### 5. JVM: verify machine code
### 6. JVM: Allocates `Heap memory` + `Data Segment`
### 7. JVM: `HEAP` = Store new Objects/Instance data - Shared beween all threads
### 8. JVM: `Data segment` [`Method Area`] = Global + Static variable stored   
- Shared beween all threads.
- After java 8 this is part of HEAP
  
### 9. JVM: `Starts` `Main thread` - Allocates= Stack (calls,local variables) + Registers + Counter
### 10. JVM: `Thread-Stack`: 
- Loads machine code on stack or can say start execution step by step
- Stores `local variables`
- keeps track of execution
- manages `method calls`
### 11. JVM: `Thread-Register`: 
- Each thread have own register. 
- `JIT` uses to optimize bytecode 
- Used for `context switching`
### 12. JVM: `Thread-Counter`: ponits to current instrcution which is getting executed 
 - Counter-points to Code segment instruction
 - let say 2 threads are there other than main thread
 - in this case pc (counter) will point to some address in Code Segment as this CodeSegment know `where to start new threa`d as JIT saves these details when converting bytecode -> machine code 

## Context Switching
- Happens when threads are more than CPU core but when core are more threads can run in parallel
- In context swithcing `counter` is used which locates `registers` and then thread will start executing tasks where it was left before (as when context switching happens it actually stores existing threads results data in registers and pc will points to that register so when again the thread loads it, counter is used for getting last instruction where it's stored)

## Multithreading
### Issues:
1. Data inconsistency
2. Synchronization issue
3. Deadlocak

## Multitasking vs Multithreading
1. Multitasking : 
    - different porocess/task
    - no share of resources
2. Multithreading
    - Multiple thread of same process
    - resources shared
