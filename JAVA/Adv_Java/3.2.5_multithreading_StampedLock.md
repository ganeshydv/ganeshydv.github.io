# StampedLock
- `Optimistic Lock + Passimistic Lock [ReadWriteLock]`
- `Optimistic Lock: No locking` 
- `Passimistic Lock`: Locking on `Code` (Locking-code block irrespective of instance) or `Object`(Synchronized)
- In StampedLock when putting lock(), we get one stamp of `type long` which indicates current version and need to give same stamp in `unlock(stamp)`
- `lock.validate(stamp)`: for validating the state for particular block of code this is to check that is there any other thread accessed this block of code already and executed properly
### ReadLock:
```java
StampedLock lock= new StampedLock();
long stamp = lock.readLock();
lock.unlockRead(stamp);//as not passimistic lock 
```
### WriteLock:
```java
StampedLock lock= new StampedLock();
long stamp = lock.writeLock();
lock.unlockWrite(stamp);
```
### Optimistic Lock: in Read: only need to validate
```java
StampedLock lock= new StampedLock();
long stamp = lock.tryOptimisticRead();
lock.validate(stamp);
```
