## Stack & Heap in RAM Created/Managed by JVM 
| Memory Area | Used For                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Heap**    | All objects and class instances (`new` keyword)              |
| **Stack**   | Method calls, local variables, return addresses (per thread) |

- Each `Thread` have own `different stack` but `common HEAP`

### üîç Does Heap/Stack allocation change during execution?
‚úîÔ∏è Yes, both Heap and Stack memory allocations evolve dynamically as code is executed line by line (instruction by instruction).


- For `Methods`: Block is created in `Stack` called "`Frames`", so this will create local variables go out of scope after execution
- For `Object`: in `HEAP`, `Ref` in `Stack`

### Strings: stored in String Pool Area of HEAP
- String Literals: not created but will be taken exisitng one if it's already present in String Pool

### After Stack execution complete: stack empty - GC clear HEAP
- `JVM manages GC` so it's automatic management 

## GC
- `Objects`
   - `Strong Referance`: Obj1 ob1=new Obj1(); never get deleted when this ref is present in stack
       - this is used most of the time
   - `Weak Referance`: List<Obj1> =new ArrayList<>(); can be deleted 
      - `Soft Refernace` (weak ref) : can be deleted urgently even if ref is present

## HEAP Memory
- Young Generarion + Old Gen  & Non HEAP (Meta Space)
### Young Gen = Eden +  S0 + S1 
- Eden stores: new Object
- S0, S1: survivour space 
- let say GC invoked (Mark & sweep Algo) --> Mark algo will check which obj have no ref in HEAP then Sweep Algo will remove them and which are survived means which have ref will be put in S0 and it's called `minor GC `and it's AGE=1
- Let say new Obj again created -->  Some Object which don't have ref will be deleted and sweep will remove them from HEAP and will move AGE=1 refs to S1 and their AGE=2 and which are moved to S0 their AGE=1
- Let say AGE=3 is our threshold anf GC again Run: MArk & Sweep same process and this time it will put ref whose AGE=3 will be put in Old generation AREA of Heap and this will be deleted using `Major GC`
### Meta Space (Permenant Gen before java 7/8): Outside of HEAP
- Class Variables (Static vars)
- Class Metadata 
- Stores Constants (static final int a=10)
> Permenant Gen was Part of HEAP in Java7/8

## GC:
- Goals
    - Throughput: increase 
    - Latency: decrease
    - why? - because it pauses Main App thread for clearing HEAP Area which affects performance of Application
1. Serrial GC: 
    - one thread 
    - Slow
    - `Expensive: All App Threads get Paused means APP will Stop`
    - `If GC slow app will become Slow`
2. parallel GC: Java 8
    - Multi Threads
    - Some what Fast
3. Concurrent Mark & Sweep : 
    - App thread + GC Thread Runs in Parallel
    - Try to delete when App thread  is still running but depends on action can be stopped
4. G1: 
    - Tried to Reduce GC time to 0
