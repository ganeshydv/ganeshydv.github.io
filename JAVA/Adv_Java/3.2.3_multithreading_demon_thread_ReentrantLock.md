# 💡 Key Principle of Locking in JAVA
### A lock (including ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock, Semaphore, Stampede) controls access to the code block, not the object — it doesn't care about the object instance, only about the lock instance.
- If multiple objects or threads share the same lock instance, then their access is coordinated.
- If they each have a different lock instance, then they act independently — even if the logic is the same.
### ✅ All lock types in Java behave this way:
- The lock controls access not based on the object it's inside, but based on the lock instance itself.
## Threads: User Thread || Demon Thread
- set: `thread.isDemon(true)`;
-  `Alive until Main thread is Alive`
- Garbage Collector: Demon Thread
- in logging can be useful

## Types of Lock

1. Monitor Lock 
   - synchronized
   - depends on object(this)
### Custom Locks: Not depend on object (No synchronized)
   - why?
       - In Monitor lock resource object is shared among thread but what if there are muliple threads with having same or different monitor object then this lock will not make any method to be accessed by single thread
       - in this scenario even if there are different instance objects (monitor) of same type it should not let access of particular code segment to any thread
       - So synchronized only ensures one thread per object, not one thread for all objects.
       - Each Thread has a new object → new monitor → no lock is shared → all threads access the code block in parallel, even if that method should be exclusive!
       - EX. database connection limit is 5 so if 10 threads want to access them it should wait 
       - `HAS-A`: in simple words, lock object is given to different monitor objects and at one time that method will be accessable by only one thread event there are muliple objects (monitors).
       - ✅ Limit access to a critical section globally, even across different instances.
2. Reentrant 
3. ReadWrite
4. semaphore
5. Stamped
# 1. Reentrant Lock:
-  Reentrant = "Re-enterable by the same thread"
- Single ReentranLock object is shared between objects which are running on different threads
- No need of synchronized
- Used directly 
- In simple words if you need some method or block to be accessed by only one thread at a time use `Reentrant lock`
```java
class SharedProductResource{
    boolean isAvailable=false;
    void producer(ReentrantLock lock){
        try{
            lock.lock();
            sout("Lock acquired by: "+Thread.currentTHread().getName());
            isAvailable=true;
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        }catch(Exception e){

        }finally{
            lock.unlock();
            sout("lock released by: "+Thread.currentTHread().getName());
        }
    }
}
class Main{
    psvm(String[] args){
        ReentrantLock lock=new ReentreantLock();
        SharedProductResource p1= new SharedProductResource();
        Thread td1= new Thread(()->{
            p1.producer(lock);
        });
        SharedProductResource p2= new SharedProductResource();
        Thread td2= new Thread(()->{
            p2.producer(lock);
        });

        td1.start();
        td2.start();
    }
}
```
## await(), Signal(), signalAll()
```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
```
- ✅ Condition.await() ~ wait()
- ✅ Condition.signal() ~ notify()
- ✅ Condition.signalAll() ~ notifyAll()
### Fairness policy: create a "`fair`" lock where `threads acquire the lock in the order requested`
- Interruptible locks
- Explicit unlocking across different code paths
## ✅ Desired Outcome: Lock shared across all instances
### ✅ Limit access to a critical section globally, even across different instances.
### 🔍 Why ReentrantLock Works in These Scenarios
### 🔸 HAS-A relationship
- The lock is not on this (the object)
- It's a field (HAS-A) that is shared across objects or components

### 🔸 Real-world analogy
- Think of 10 API servers (10 object instances)
- Only 5 DB connections available


### ✅ Summary
- Use synchronized when thread safety is needed at object level.
- Use ReentrantLock when:
   - You want explicit control
   - Need to protect a shared global resource
   - Want to enforce locking across different object instances
   - Need timeout, interruptible waits, or fairness
