## Monitor Locks: for accessing block of code
- it helps to make sure that one 1 thread goes inside particular section of code(a `synchronized` block or method)
- put using `synchronized` keyword before method or block of code
- `Runnable/Running` : put Monitor Block
- `Blocked + waiting` : releases Monitor block
- `Timed Waiting` : not releases Monitor block
### Example:
```java
class MonitorLock{
    synchronized void task1(){
        sout("sync task 1");
        Thread.sleep(10000);
    }

    void task2(){
        sout("task 2: before sync-lock")
        synchronized(this){//this will try to put lock on whole object(this) - so if there is already a lock on some resource of this object by other thread T1 (here task1()) and then if anyother thread T2 calls task2 then it will wait for release of lock by T1 on task1 
            sout("task 2: inside sync");
        }
    }

    void task3(){
        sout("task 3");
    }

}
```
