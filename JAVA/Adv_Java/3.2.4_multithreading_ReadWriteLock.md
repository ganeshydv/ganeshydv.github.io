# Read Write Lock
## üîç What is ReadWriteLock?
- It's a concurrency utility that allows multiple threads to read a shared resource simultaneously, but only one thread to write, and no reads during writing.
### Shared Lock (Read lock): 
- T1 & T2 (or more Threads) can both put this lock on same object but  
- they can only read and
- can not write it.
- if there is Shared lock already then Can not put Exclusive lock.
- if there is Shared lock already then Can put Shared lock.

### Exclusive Lock (Write lock):
- can Read and also can write i.e. change the value of objects.
- Shared (Read) lock  not allowed when there is Exlusive (Write) lock
- Only 1 thread can acquire?
## üîë Problem It Solves:
- With a normal ReentrantLock or synchronized block:
- Only one thread (read or write) can access the resource at a time.
- But many times we want:
    - Many readers (non-conflicting)
    - Only one writer (exclusive)

- You don‚Äôt want all 10 reads to block just because one thread is reading ‚Äî only block when a write happens.
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Writers are exclusive ‚Äî no other reader or writer allowed during write
- Fairness is not guaranteed by default ‚Üí use:
```java
new ReentrantReadWriteLock(true); // fair mode
```
## How ReentrantReadWriteLock works:  
- Multiple threads can hold the read lock at the same time, allowing concurrent reads.
- When a thread acquires the write lock, it blocks all other reads and writes until it releases the lock.
- In your output, reads and writes are interleaved, but no read happens while a write lock is held.
## üß† Use Case:
Let‚Äôs say you have:
- 1 shared config file or cache
- 10 threads read it frequently
- Occasionally, 1 thread updates it
```java
ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
Lock readLock = lock.readLock();
Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();
```
## üß† So what happens inside high-level locks like ReadWriteLock?
Internally, they manage thread parking/unparking using lower-level primitives like:
- LockSupport.park()
- FIFO thread queues
- CAS + Unsafe memory access (for performance)

You don‚Äôt need to call wait()/notify() ‚Äî the library takes care of who gets notified and when.

### Example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.*;

class SharedCache {
    private String data = "initial";
    private final ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final Lock readLock = rwLock.readLock();
    private final Lock writeLock = rwLock.writeLock();

    public void readData(String threadName) {
        readLock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(threadName + " reading data: " + data);
            ////in these 3 seconds if any thread tries to write it will wait until all read threads will complete and read lock is released
            Thread.sleep(3000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        } finally {
            readLock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void writeData(String threadName, String newData) {
        writeLock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(threadName + " writing data...");
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            data = newData;
            System.out.println(threadName + " wrote data: " + data);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        } finally {
            writeLock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedCache cache = new SharedCache();

        // 5 reader threads
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            final int id = i;
            new Thread(() -> cache.readData("Reader-" + id)).start();
           // all the read threads will run concurrently
        }

        // 2 writer threads
        new Thread(() -> cache.writeData("Writer-1", "updated-by-w1")).start();
        new Thread(() -> cache.writeData("Writer-2", "updated-by-w2")).start();
    }
}

```
## üìä What Happens Internally?
| Operation     | Behavior                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Reader-Reader | ‚úÖ Can run concurrently                   |
| Reader-Writer | ‚ùå Writer waits for all readers to finish |
| Writer-Reader | ‚ùå Readers wait for writer to finish      |
| Writer-Writer | ‚ùå Only one writer at a time              |

## üìå Use Cases in System Design
| Use Case        | ReadWriteLock Usage                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Config server   | Reads are frequent, writes rare                |
| Cache system    | Read-heavy: threads can read concurrently      |
| Product catalog | All users browse (read), admin updates (write) |

## üß† Advantages
- Better performance in read-heavy systems
- More granular control than synchronized
- Prevents starvation using fairness policies

## Disadvantages
- no wait(), signal() like for ReentrantLock so can not be used for subscriber-consumer 
- no tryLock() lock like ReentrantLock so can not check if lock is available before locking so sequential locking of different threads is not possible 

## ‚úÖ Summary
| Lock Type     | Readers Allowed?    | Writers Allowed?  |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| `readLock()`  | ‚úÖ Yes, concurrently | ‚ùå No              |
| `writeLock()` | ‚ùå No                | ‚úÖ One thread only |
