## Memory Management:
- Java handles memory management and gc using JVM automatically.

### 🧠 1. Who Manages Memory in Java?
- ✅ JVM is responsible for memory management in Java.
- It allocates memory for:
    - Class loading
    - Objects
    - Stack frames
    - Method calls
    - Garbage collection
### 🧱 2. Java Memory Areas (Runtime Memory Structure)
Here's a visual/text breakdown of Java memory inside the JVM:
```pgsql
+----------------------------+
|    Method Area (MetaSpace)|
+----------------------------+
|          Heap             |
|  (Objects, class instances)|
+----------------------------+
|          Stack            |
| (Method calls, local vars)|
+----------------------------+
|     Program Counter (PC)  |
+----------------------------+
|     Native Method Stack   |
+----------------------------+
```
| Memory Area             | Role                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heap**                | Stores all Java objects & class instances. Managed by GC.             |
| **Method Area**         | Stores metadata (class, method info). In Java 8+, part of Metaspace.  |
| **Stack**               | Each thread gets a stack. Stores method call frames, local variables. |
| **PC Register**         | Keeps track of current instruction per thread.                        |
| **Native Method Stack** | For native code execution (e.g., JNI).                                |

## So by any chance u mean all java codes will run inside memory created by JVM? and JVM created memory for each java code
   - Yes, you're exactly right — every Java program runs inside memory allocated by the JVM, and JVM creates and manages that memory for each running Java program (also called a Java process).

### ✅ 1. “All Java code runs inside memory created by JVM?”
✔️ Yes.
- When you execute a Java program (using java MyApp), here's what happens:
   - JVM starts.
   - Loads the class MyApp
   - Looks for the public static void main(String[] args) method
   - Starts a main thread to run that method
   - It allocates memory (Heap, Stack, etc.).
   - It loads your compiled .class files (bytecode).
   - It executes bytecode line by line (using interpreter or JIT compiler).
   - JVM manages everything — memory, execution, GC, etc.
- ➡️ So your code never touches system memory directly like in C/C++. It lives completely inside JVM memory space.

### ✅ 2. “JVM creates memory for each Java code?”
✔️ Yes, per Java process.
- For every Java application, JVM spins up its own memory space, which includes:
    - Its own Heap (objects, class instances)
    - Its own Stacks (per thread)
    - Its own Metaspace (class metadata)
    - Its own GC management and tracking

- 📌 That means:
    - If you run java A and then separately run java B, both A and B run in separate JVM instances, with separate memory.
    - They're completely isolated from each other (like different Docker containers).

## 🔍 Visual Breakdown:

JVM instance created
```arduino
JVM Memory:
 ├─ Heap (your objects)
 ├─ Stack (method calls, vars)
 ├─ Metaspace (class data)
 └─ GC running in background
```
