## Maven Life Cycle :

- Order is : **`Life Cycle <== Phase <== Goal`**
     1. Life Cycle : ex. clean, build
     2. Phase : stages or High level goal in LifeCycle 
         - ex: Compile, test, package, etc.
    3. Goals : specific task 
        - ex. compiling code, running test cases, etc.
## Three Maven Lifecycles
1. Clean Lifecycle: 
    - Prepares the project for a fresh build by removing previously     
    - built artifacts.
    - Phases:
        1. pre-clean: Executes tasks before cleaning (e.g., backups).
        1. clean: Deletes files generated by previous builds (e.g., target/ folder).
        1. post-clean: Executes tasks after cleaning.
2. Default Lifecycle (Build Lifecycle): 

    - Handles the complete project build process.
    - Phases (key ones):
        1. validate: Validates the project configuration (e.g., ensures pom.xml is correct).
        1. compile: Compiles the source code.
        1. test: Runs unit tests using frameworks like JUnit.
        1. package: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).
        1. verify: Ensures the package meets quality standards (e.g., integration tests).
        1. install: Installs the package to the local repository (for use by other local projects).
        1. deploy: Copies the built package to a remote repository (e.g., Maven Central or an internal repo).
3. Site Lifecycle: 
    - Used to generate project documentation.
    - Phases:
        1. pre-site: Executes tasks before generating documentation.
        1. site: Generates project documentation (e.g., reports, project site).
        1. post-site: Executes tasks after generating documentation.
        1. site-deploy: Deploys the documentation to a web server or repository.

## Key Phases in the Default Lifecycle
| **Phase**  | **Description**     |
|------------|--------------------|
| `validate` | Ensures the project is correctly configured and all necessary files are present.  `install Dependency` [in .m2 folder of local] |
| `compile`  | Compiles the project's source code. `check Dependency`   |
| `test`     | Runs unit tests (if any).   |
| `package`  | Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., `.jar` or `.war`).   |
| `verify`   | Runs checks to ensure the package is valid and meets quality standards (e.g., integration tests). |
| `install`  | Installs the package into the local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`).   |
| `deploy`   | Uploads the package to a remote repository (e.g., Maven Central or an internal repository). |


## Real-Life Example
- Suppose you're developing a library:
1. Build Process:
   1. Run `mvn compile` to compile the Java code.
   1. Run `mvn test` to execute unit tests.
   1. Run `mvn package` to create a my-library-1.0.jar file in the target directory.

2. Deployment:
   1. Run `mvn install` to make the JAR available locally for other projects.
   1. Run `mvn deploy` to upload it to a remote repository for global use.
