# EXOR : use for canceling same elements 
  Ex:  when iterating over array need to find ele which is not repeated twice
  arr=[1,1,2,5,4,2,3,3,5,6,6]
  ans: 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 6 = 7
  nums: 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 6
  op = ans ^ nums = 4;
  EX2: 1^1=0 but 1^1^1 =1
    both same then 0 else 1
    1^2=[0-1]^[1-0]=[1-1]=3

# Hash Map : when need to remeber somethig 

# TWO Pointer : when need to compare or need to make only half iterations
