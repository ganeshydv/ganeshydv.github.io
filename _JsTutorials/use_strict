explain about 'use strict'

ChatGPT
The 'use strict'; directive is a special string literal in JavaScript that enables strict mode within a script or a specific function scope. When you include this directive at the beginning of a script or a function, it instructs the JavaScript interpreter to enforce a stricter set of rules and behavior. Here's an explanation of what strict mode entails:

Strict Syntax Parsing: Strict mode requires JavaScript code to follow stricter syntax rules. It disallows the use of certain syntax that is prone to errors or ambiguity. For example, without strict mode, you can create variables without declaring them with the var, let, or const keywords. But in strict mode, this would be a syntax error.

Prevents Silent Errors: In non-strict mode, some mistakes or errors are silently ignored or handled in a way that may not be intuitive. Strict mode changes this behavior and turns many silent errors into explicit errors or exceptions. This helps in identifying and fixing potential issues earlier.

Variable Scope Enforcement: Strict mode enforces better scoping rules. For instance, variables declared inside a block with let or const are limited to that block in strict mode. In non-strict mode, such variables would "leak" out of the block scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Prevents Implicit Global Variables: In non-strict mode, if you assign a value to a variable that has not been explicitly declared, JavaScript creates a new global variable automatically. This behavior can lead to accidental global variable pollution. In strict mode, such assignments result in a reference error, avoiding the implicit creation of global variables.

Restricted Functionality: Strict mode disables or modifies some features that are considered error-prone or problematic. For example, the this value is undefined in functions that are not methods or constructors, preventing accidental use of the global object as this.

Evolution-friendly Mode: Strict mode ensures that JavaScript code follows a stricter set of rules, making it easier for future versions of JavaScript to introduce new features without breaking existing code. It helps to avoid conflicts with potential reserved keywords in future ECMAScript specifications.

To enable strict mode for an entire script, include 'use strict'; at the beginning of the file before any other code. To enable strict mode for a specific function, include 'use strict'; at the beginning of the function body.
