### NPM vs NPX

npm and npx are both command-line tools that come with Node.js, but they serve different purposes:

### npm (Node Package Manager):

- Used to manage packages (libraries or modules) for Node.js.
- Common commands include:
- npm install : Installs a package.
- npm init: Initializes a new Node.js project.
- npm run : Runs a script defined in the package.json file.
- Example:

```cmd
npm install typescript --save-dev
```
### npx (Node Package Execute):
- Used to execute binaries from Node modules.
- Allows you to run commands from packages without installing them globally.
- Useful for running one-off commands or scripts.
- Example:
- In summary, npm is primarily for managing packages, while npx is for executing binaries from those packages.

```cmd
npx tsc --init
```
