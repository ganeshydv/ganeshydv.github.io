# General flow:
sending a request to server 
generally what happena:
1. device get IP assigned by ISP because of DHCP
2. ISP - router saves device assigned  IP+ device MAC in ARP table --> and in MAC table  saves: Device MAC+PORT
3. when request in made to some site/server -->
    - device app :data-->data+ port-->data+port+source IP+destination IP -->[data+port+source IP+destination Ip ]+source Mac address +destination MAC  --> 
    - Router : searches for target ip using subnet mask in local if not found --> replaces source MAC with own MAC and using route table decides next hop MAC may be next router or  gateway --> 
    - this happens until device reaches destination IP (server) --> server process and response start by swap - source address now becomes destination address and destination becomes source (in this process I have doubt like  do this follow this approach [device ip 1 --> router 1 ip --> router 2 ip --> server if this is true then how reponse comes back to source device ) --> find destination Ip same process one hop to another-->in the end it comes to main router/ISP which

## IN newtork request SOURCE IP and DESTINATION IP NEVER Changes only MAC is Changed

### Q1)  See the doubt I have is each router or next hop is going to send request to next hop but before that it will change it's source IP to it's own IP and same for mac right now do each hop will map IP's like source Ip : hop's Ip so it will redirect back when reponse is processed?


- Ah, I see your confusion now! You're asking whether each hop (router) along the path changes the source IP to its own IP, and if that means each hop needs to map the IPs for the response to return correctly. Let me clarify this step-by-step.

### 1. IP Address and MAC Address in Routing:
   - At each hop (each router), the following happens:
   
   - `Source IP`: ***`The source IP (which is the original device's IP address) remains unchanged as it travels through the network`***. The source IP only changes if NAT (Network Address Translation) is involved (which is common in home or private networks).
   
   - `Destination IP`: ***`The destination IP (the server’s IP) also remains unchanged throughout the hops`***. Routers do not modify the destination IP—they only perform routing decisions based on the destination IP and forward the packet accordingly.
   
   - `Source MAC:` The source MAC address changes at each hop because each router is forwarding the packet to the next hop (and each router has its own MAC address). Each router uses the MAC address of the next hop to forward the packet. The original device’s MAC address is only used by the first router (or switch) that directly connects to the device.
   
   - `Destination MAC:` The destination MAC address will change at each hop, too. It's updated based on the router that will handle the next part of the journey. For example:
   
   - The first router will set the destination MAC address to the MAC of the next router or the destination device if it's the last hop.

### 2. What Happens During Routing (Request Flow):
Let’s break down the request step-by-step for the forwarding process (from device to server):

   1. Device to First Router:
   
       - The device sends a packet to a server (e.g., www.example.com).
       - The source IP is the device's private IP (192.168.1.10), and the destination IP is the server's public IP (93.184.216.34).
       - The source MAC is the device's MAC address, and the destination MAC is the router's MAC address.
       - The router receives the packet, checks the destination IP, and uses its routing table to determine the next hop (which might be another router or the server’s IP).
    
   2. Router 1 to Router 2 (and so on):
   
       - Router 1 forwards the packet to the next router, using the next router's MAC address as the destination MAC.
       - The source MAC changes to Router 1’s MAC address.
       - The destination IP (the server’s IP) and source IP (the device’s IP) remain unchanged.
       - The packet continues to hop through routers, with each hop updating the source MAC and next-hop MAC, but not modifying the source or destination IP.
   
   3. Final Router to Server:
   
       - The final router forwards the packet to the server, and the destination MAC is the server's NIC (network interface card) MAC address.
       - The server now processes the request, and it prepares a response to the source IP (192.168.1.10).

3. What Happens During Response (Reverse Flow)?
When the response comes back, here's the flow:

    1. Server Response:

        - The server sends the response to the destination IP (192.168.1.10).
        - The packet follows the same route back (reverse route).
        - The destination IP still remains as 192.168.1.10, and the source IP remains the server's IP (e.g., 93.184.216.34).
    2. Return Path and NAT:
        - If the original request went through NAT (like in most home or private networks), the router at the edge (the one with the public IP) keeps track of the source port and IP mapping from the outgoing request.
        - When the response comes back to the router (using the public IP), the router checks its NAT table and translates the public IP back to the correct internal device’s private IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
        - NAT ensures that the packet is forwarded to the correct internal device, and the destination IP is modified by the router to match the private IP of the device.

    3. Forwarding the Response:
        - Each router along the path back will look at the destination IP (which is now the device's public IP or NATed IP).
        - Each router forwards the packet to the next hop until it reaches the router closest to the original device.
        - The final router will use NAT (if necessary) to route the packet to the correct internal device (private IP).
        - The packet will finally reach the device.
### Key Points for the Response Flow:
1. Mapping IPs for Response:
    - Each hop along the way does not need to explicitly map the source IP to the router's IP. Instead, the source IP remains unchanged as long as NAT is not involved. If NAT is involved, the router maps outgoing packets from private IPs to its public IP and vice versa.
2. Role of NAT in the Response:
    - NAT at the router is what ensures the response from the server reaches the correct internal device. Without NAT, the routers would simply route packets based on the IP addresses, and there would be no need for the routers to track or "map" the source IP to each hop.
### Summary:
1. Each hop (router) along the way does not modify the source or destination IP. The source IP remains the same throughout the journey until it reaches the server, and the destination IP remains the server's IP.
2. NAT is responsible for translating the private IP of the device into a public IP when leaving the network, and then translating it back to the private IP when the response comes in.
3. Routers only modify the MAC address (because they are forwarding the packet to the next hop), but they don’t map IPs between hops unless NAT is involved.
4. In essence, each router forwards packets based on destination IP and updates the MAC address, but the source IP (in most cases) does not need to be "mapped" at each hop unless NAT is being used.

## Q2) I got one thing here every network is considered as local network as request goes from device to  next hop to next hop to destination as MAC is in the end used to check next hop now here do route table is only used to get IP of next hop and based on IP get MAC of next hops so can forward request to it this is it right


- Yes, you are on the right track! Let me explain how these tables and processes work together:

1. How the Routing Process Works:
Packet Creation:

When a device (let’s say Device A) wants to send data to a destination, it creates a packet that contains the destination IP (the IP address of the final destination device, or server).
Local Network Check:

The device checks if the destination IP is in the same local network (same subnet). If the destination IP is on the same network, the device can directly communicate with the destination.
If the destination is outside the local network, the device needs to send the packet to the router (or the default gateway), which will forward it to the next hop.
Use of Routing Table:

Routers (Layer 3 devices) make decisions based on the destination IP.
The router looks up its routing table to determine the next hop for the packet.
Routing table entries typically contain:
Destination Network/Prefix: The range of IP addresses.
Next Hop IP: The IP address of the next hop router or the final destination.
Forwarding to Next Hop:

Once the router identifies the next hop IP using its routing table, it forwards the packet to that IP.
At each hop, the packet needs to reach the next router, so each router uses its routing table to determine the next destination.
MAC Address Lookup (Layer 2):

Now that the router knows the next hop IP, it needs to forward the packet to the next router or destination device via Layer 2 (the Data Link Layer).
The router uses the ARP table (or ARP protocol) to resolve the next hop IP to a MAC address.
For example, if the router needs to forward the packet to the next router, it will use ARP to find the MAC address corresponding to the next hop IP.
MAC Address Forwarding:

Once the router knows the MAC address of the next hop, it forwards the packet using the destination MAC address and the next hop IP. The source MAC will be the router's own MAC address, and the destination MAC will be the MAC address of the next hop (either another router or the destination device).
The packet will continue to hop from one router to another, updating the source and destination MAC addresses, but keeping the source and destination IP addresses the same.
In Summary:
Routing Table: Used by routers to find the next hop IP based on the destination IP.
ARP Table: Used to map the next hop IP to a MAC address, so the router can forward the packet to the correct port.
MAC Table: Used by switches to forward packets within a local network based on MAC addresses.
At each hop:

The routing table is used to determine where the packet should go next (based on the destination IP).
The ARP table is used to resolve the next hop IP to a MAC address, which is required to forward the packet at Layer 2.
The MAC address is used to send the packet to the correct next-hop device (router or final destination device).
So, to clarify your question: Yes, the routing table helps the router decide the next hop IP, and then the ARP table resolves that IP to a MAC address to forward the packet at Layer 2.
