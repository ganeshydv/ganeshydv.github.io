## Q] how device know if destination ip is in local network or external netwrok


### 1. Devices determine whether the destination IP address is within the local 
network or on an external network based on the subnet information and the network 
configuration. This determination is made using the device's subnet mask and 
the concept of network address classes.

Here's a simplified explanation:

### 1] Subnet Information:

- Each device in a network is assigned an IP address along with a subnet mask.
- The subnet mask helps the device identify the network portion and host 
portion of the IP address.

### 2] Local Network vs. External Network:

- If the destination IP address falls within the same network as the sendingdevice (i.e., the network portion of the IP addresses matches), the devices are in the same local network.

- If the destination IP address falls outside the local network 
(i.e., the network portions are different), the destination is considered 
to be on an external network.

### 3] Routing Decision:

- If the destination is within the local network, the device may use ARP to find the MAC address and communicate directly within the local network.
- If the destination is on an external network, the device may need to send the data to a router (gateway) for further routing.

### 4] Default Gateway:

- Devices are often configured with a default gateway (router) that acts as the entry point to reach devices on external networks.
- If the device determines that the destination is external, it forwards the data to the default gateway, which is responsible for routing the data to the appropriate external network.

In summary, the device relies on its knowledge of its own IP address, 
subnet mask, and default gateway to determine whether the destination 
is within the local network or on an external network. 
This information is crucial for making routing decisions and 
efficiently directing data to its intended destination.
