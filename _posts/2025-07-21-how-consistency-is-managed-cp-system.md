## How Consistency is managed? (CP system)
- `All clients see the same data, even if they connect to different nodes.`
- In CP system there will be Only one main write node and other will be read replicas.
- EX. N0 (primary DB) Write, N1 (Region 1), N2 (Region 2) wi

## ‚úÖ In CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance) systems:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è There is only one writable replica at a time
- ‚ùå Multiple nodes are not allowed to write simultaneously

This is how strong consistency is enforced.

## üîπ CP Systems (Consistency First)
- Only one writable node (e.g., MongoDB primary, PostgreSQL primary)
- Replicas are read-only
- If partition happens:
  - Writes are blocked until majority is reachable
  - No split-brain (no conflicting writes)
- Tradeoff: ‚úÖ Safe data, ‚ùå less availability
- ‚úÖ Strong consistency
- ‚ùå Might `return error during network partition`

## ‚úÖ Real Example 2: MongoDB (CP)
- Prioritizes consistency: writes go to the primary, secondaries sync afterward
- If primary goes down, write may fail during failover (i.e., system becomes temporarily unavailable)
- ### Why CP?
  - Avoids inconsistent writes
  - Accepts short unavailability during failover
