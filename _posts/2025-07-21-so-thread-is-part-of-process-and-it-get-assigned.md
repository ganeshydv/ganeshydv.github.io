### so thread is part of process? and it get assigned stack will it also from process stack? : YES: created by OS in kernal SPace : yes

# Understanding Threads

A thread is a part of a process, created by the OS in Kernel Space. Threads share the same memory space and resources within a process, including the process's memory, file descriptors, and other system resources.

## Threads Within a Process

A process can have one or more threads of execution. These threads share the same memory space, address space, and resources within the process. Each thread within a process has its own execution context, including a program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP), and set of CPU registers. Threads within the same process can communicate and share data directly, without the need for inter-process communication mechanisms.

## Thread Creation

Threads are typically created within a process using system calls or threading libraries provided by the operating system or programming language runtime. When a thread is created within a process, it is assigned its own stack for storing local variables, function parameters, and return addresses. The stack for each thread is separate from the process's main stack and is typically allocated from the process's memory space.

## Stack Allocation to Thread

When a thread is created, the operating system allocates a separate stack for the thread within the process's memory space. Each thread's stack is independent of the process's main stack and has its own stack pointer (SP) to keep track of the current stack frame. The size of the stack for each thread may be fixed or configurable, depending on the platform and application requirements.

In summary, threads are indeed a part of a process and share the same memory space and resources within the process. When a thread is created, it is assigned its own stack, separate from the process's main stack, to store local variables and function call information. Threads within the same process can execute concurrently and share data directly, facilitating parallelism and concurrency within the process.

### ---------------------------------------------
Yes, a thread is indeed a part of a process. 
Threads share the same memory space and resources 
within a process, including the process's memory, 
file descriptors, and other system resources.
Here's how threads are related to processes:

Threads Within a Process:

A process can have one or more threads of execution. 
These threads share the same memory space, 
address space, and resources within the process.
Each thread within a process has its own 
execution context, including a program counter (PC), 
stack pointer (SP), and set of CPU registers.
Threads within the same process can communicate 
and share data directly, without the need for 
inter-process communication mechanisms.

Thread Creation:

Threads are typically created within a process 
using system calls or threading libraries provided 
by the operating system or programming language runtime.
When a thread is created within a process, it is 
assigned its own stack for storing local variables, 
function parameters, and return addresses.
The stack for each thread is separate from the 
process's main stack and is typically allocated 
from the process's memory space.

Stack Allocation to Thread:

When a thread is created, the operating system 
allocates a separate stack for the thread within 
the process's memory space.
Each thread's stack is independent of the process's 
main stack and has its own stack pointer (SP) to keep 
track of the current stack frame.
The size of the stack for each thread may be fixed 
or configurable, depending on the platform and application 
requirements.

In summary, threads are indeed a part of a process and share the same memory space and resources within the process. When a thread is created, it is assigned its own stack, separate from the process's main stack, to store local variables and function call information. Threads within the same process can execute concurrently and share data directly, facilitating parallelism and concurrency within the process.
