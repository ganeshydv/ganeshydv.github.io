# General flow:
sending a request to server 
generally what happena:
1. device get IP assigned by ISP because of DHCP
2. ISP - router saves device assigned  IP+ device MAC in ARP table --> and in MAC table  saves: Device MAC+PORT
3. when request in made to some site/server -->
    - device app :data-->data+ port-->data+port+source IP+destination IP -->[data+port+source IP+destination Ip ]+source Mac address +destination MAC  --> 
    - Router : searches for target ip using subnet mask in local if not found --> replaces source MAC with own MAC and using route table decides next hop MAC may be next router or  gateway --> 
    - this happens until device reaches destination IP (server) --> server process and response start by swap - source address now becomes destination address and destination becomes source (in this process I have doubt like  do this follow this approach [device ip 1 --> router 1 ip --> router 2 ip --> server if this is true then how reponse comes back to source device ) --> find destination Ip same process one hop to another-->in the end it comes to main router/ISP which  
#
## IN newtork request SOURCE IP and DESTINATION IP NEVER Changes only MAC is Changed

### Q1)  See the doubt I have is each router or next hop is going to send request to next hop but before that it will change it's source IP to it's own IP and same for mac right now do each hop will map IP's like source Ip : hop's Ip so it will redirect back when reponse is processed?


- Ah, I see your confusion now! You're asking whether each hop (router) along the path changes the source IP to its own IP, and if that means each hop needs to map the IPs for the response to return correctly. Let me clarify this step-by-step.

### 1. IP Address and MAC Address in Routing:
   - At each hop (each router), the following happens:
   
   - `Source IP`: ***`The source IP (which is the original device's IP address) remains unchanged as it travels through the network`***. The source IP only changes if NAT (Network Address Translation) is involved (which is common in home or private networks).
   
   - `Destination IP`: ***`The destination IP (the server’s IP) also remains unchanged throughout the hops`***. Routers do not modify the destination IP—they only perform routing decisions based on the destination IP and forward the packet accordingly.
   
   - `Source MAC:` The source MAC address changes at each hop because each router is forwarding the packet to the next hop (and each router has its own MAC address). Each router uses the MAC address of the next hop to forward the packet. The original device’s MAC address is only used by the first router (or switch) that directly connects to the device.
   
   - `Destination MAC:` The destination MAC address will change at each hop, too. It's updated based on the router that will handle the next part of the journey. For example:
   
   - The first router will set the destination MAC address to the MAC of the next router or the destination device if it's the last hop.

### 2. What Happens During Routing (Request Flow):
Let’s break down the request step-by-step for the forwarding process (from device to server):

   1. Device to First Router:
   
       - The device sends a packet to a server (e.g., www.example.com).
       - The source IP is the device's private IP (192.168.1.10), and the destination IP is the server's public IP (93.184.216.34).
       - The source MAC is the device's MAC address, and the destination MAC is the router's MAC address.
       - The router receives the packet, checks the destination IP, and uses its routing table to determine the next hop (which might be another router or the server’s IP).
    
   2. Router 1 to Router 2 (and so on):
   
       - Router 1 forwards the packet to the next router, using the next router's MAC address as the destination MAC.
       - The source MAC changes to Router 1’s MAC address.
       - The destination IP (the server’s IP) and source IP (the device’s IP) remain unchanged.
       - The packet continues to hop through routers, with each hop updating the source MAC and next-hop MAC, but not modifying the source or destination IP.
   
   3. Final Router to Server:
   
       - The final router forwards the packet to the server, and the destination MAC is the server's NIC (network interface card) MAC address.
       - The server now processes the request, and it prepares a response to the source IP (192.168.1.10).

3. What Happens During Response (Reverse Flow)?
When the response comes back, here's the flow:

    1. Server Response:

        - The server sends the response to the destination IP (192.168.1.10).
        - The packet follows the same route back (reverse route).
        - The destination IP still remains as 192.168.1.10, and the source IP remains the server's IP (e.g., 93.184.216.34).
    2. Return Path and NAT:
        - If the original request went through NAT (like in most home or private networks), the router at the edge (the one with the public IP) keeps track of the source port and IP mapping from the outgoing request.
        - When the response comes back to the router (using the public IP), the router checks its NAT table and translates the public IP back to the correct internal device’s private IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
        - NAT ensures that the packet is forwarded to the correct internal device, and the destination IP is modified by the router to match the private IP of the device.

    3. Forwarding the Response:
        - Each router along the path back will look at the destination IP (which is now the device's public IP or NATed IP).
        - Each router forwards the packet to the next hop until it reaches the router closest to the original device.
        - The final router will use NAT (if necessary) to route the packet to the correct internal device (private IP).
        - The packet will finally reach the device.
### Key Points for the Response Flow:
1. Mapping IPs for Response:
    - Each hop along the way does not need to explicitly map the source IP to the router's IP. Instead, the source IP remains unchanged as long as NAT is not involved. If NAT is involved, the router maps outgoing packets from private IPs to its public IP and vice versa.
2. Role of NAT in the Response:
    - NAT at the router is what ensures the response from the server reaches the correct internal device. Without NAT, the routers would simply route packets based on the IP addresses, and there would be no need for the routers to track or "map" the source IP to each hop.
### Summary:
1. Each hop (router) along the way does not modify the source or destination IP. The source IP remains the same throughout the journey until it reaches the server, and the destination IP remains the server's IP.
2. NAT is responsible for translating the private IP of the device into a public IP when leaving the network, and then translating it back to the private IP when the response comes in.
3. Routers only modify the MAC address (because they are forwarding the packet to the next hop), but they don’t map IPs between hops unless NAT is involved.
4. In essence, each router forwards packets based on destination IP and updates the MAC address, but the source IP (in most cases) does not need to be "mapped" at each hop unless NAT is being used.
#

## Q2) I got one thing here every network is considered as local network as request goes from device to  next hop to next hop to destination as MAC is in the end used to check next hop now here do route table is only used to get IP of next hop and based on IP get MAC of next hops so can forward request to it this is it right


- Yes, you are on the right track! Let me explain how these tables and processes work together:

1. How the Routing Process Works:
Packet Creation:

When a device (let’s say Device A) wants to send data to a destination, it creates a packet that contains the destination IP (the IP address of the final destination device, or server).
Local Network Check:

The device checks if the destination IP is in the same local network (same subnet). If the destination IP is on the same network, the device can directly communicate with the destination.
If the destination is outside the local network, the device needs to send the packet to the router (or the default gateway), which will forward it to the next hop.
Use of Routing Table:

Routers (Layer 3 devices) make decisions based on the destination IP.
The router looks up its routing table to determine the next hop for the packet.
Routing table entries typically contain:
Destination Network/Prefix: The range of IP addresses.
Next Hop IP: The IP address of the next hop router or the final destination.
Forwarding to Next Hop:

Once the router identifies the next hop IP using its routing table, it forwards the packet to that IP.
At each hop, the packet needs to reach the next router, so each router uses its routing table to determine the next destination.
MAC Address Lookup (Layer 2):

Now that the router knows the next hop IP, it needs to forward the packet to the next router or destination device via Layer 2 (the Data Link Layer).
The router uses the ARP table (or ARP protocol) to resolve the next hop IP to a MAC address.
For example, if the router needs to forward the packet to the next router, it will use ARP to find the MAC address corresponding to the next hop IP.
MAC Address Forwarding:

Once the router knows the MAC address of the next hop, it forwards the packet using the destination MAC address and the next hop IP. The source MAC will be the router's own MAC address, and the destination MAC will be the MAC address of the next hop (either another router or the destination device).
The packet will continue to hop from one router to another, updating the source and destination MAC addresses, but keeping the source and destination IP addresses the same.
In Summary:
Routing Table: Used by routers to find the next hop IP based on the destination IP.
ARP Table: Used to map the next hop IP to a MAC address, so the router can forward the packet to the correct port.
MAC Table: Used by switches to forward packets within a local network based on MAC addresses.
At each hop:

The routing table is used to determine where the packet should go next (based on the destination IP).
The ARP table is used to resolve the next hop IP to a MAC address, which is required to forward the packet at Layer 2.
The MAC address is used to send the packet to the correct next-hop device (router or final destination device).
So, to clarify your question: Yes, the routing table helps the router decide the next hop IP, and then the ARP table resolves that IP to a MAC address to forward the packet at Layer 2.

## Can you explain and TLS and what are the significance it has

- TLS stands for Transport Layer Security,
and it is a cryptographic protocol used to secure communication over a computer network,
most commonly the internet. TLS is the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
and is designed to provide secure and private communication between two parties,
typically a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., a website).

The significance of TLS lies in its ability to ensure three primary security goals:

### 1. Encryption: TLS encrypts the data exchanged between the client
and server, making it unreadable to anyone intercepting the communication. 
This prevents unauthorized parties from understanding the sensitive information being transmitted,
such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.

### 2. Authentication: TLS provides a way for the client 
and server to verify each other's identities. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks,
where an attacker could intercept the communication and
impersonate one of the parties to gain access to sensitive information.

### 3. Data Integrity: TLS ensures that the data sent between the client and 
server remains unchanged during transmission. 
It uses message authentication codes (MACs) or cryptographic hash functions 
to verify that the data has not been tampered with while in transit.

TLS is widely used, especially in web browsing.
When you see "https://" in the URL of a website,
it indicates that TLS is being used to secure the connection between your web browser 
and the website's server. 
Additionally, many other applications and protocols, 
such as email (SMTP, IMAP), instant messaging (XMPP), and virtual private networks (VPNs), 
also rely on TLS to protect data during transmission.

The adoption of TLS has significantly enhanced the security of online communication, 
helping to protect sensitive data and maintain user privacy. 
It has become an essential part of modern internet security and 
is continuously being updated to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## can you explain hot TLS works

Certainly! Transport Layer Security (TLS) works through a series of steps,
commonly known as the TLS handshake.
This handshake process occurs when a client (e.g., a web browser) 
initiates a connection to a server (e.g., a website). 
Let's go through the steps of how TLS works:

### 1]Client Hello: 
```text
The TLS handshake begins with the client sending a "Client Hello" message to the server.
This message includes information about the TLS version supported by the client,
a random number (called the "Client Random"),  <------------------ Client Random
and a list of cryptographic algorithms and parameters that the client can use.
```

### 2]Server Hello: 
```text
Upon receiving the Client Hello message,
the server responds with a "Server Hello" message. 
The server selects the highest TLS version that both the client and server support. 
It generates a random number (called the "Server Random")  <------------- "Server Random"
and selects a set of cryptographic algorithms and parameters to be used for the secure connection.
```

### 3]Server Certificate: 
```text
The server sends its digital certificate to the client. 
This certificate contains the server's public key and      <----------  server's public key
is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). 
The client will use this certificate to verify the server's identity.
```

### 4]Key Exchange: 
```text
The client generates a pre-master secret,       <------------ pre-master secret, by client
encrypts it with the server's public key (from the certificate),  
and sends it back to the server. 
This step ensures that only the server, 
with its corresponding private key, can decrypt the pre-master secret.
```

### 5]Session Key Derivation: 
```text
Both the client and the server use the Client Random,          
Server Random, and pre-master secret to independently derive a "session key."  
<----- Client Random + Server Random + pre-master secret ==>  session key. == by both
This session key will be used for encryption and decryption during the secure session.
```

### 6]Authentication and Key Exchange: 
```text
The client also sends its digital certificate to 
the server if the server requires client authentication. 
The server verifies the client's identity using the client's certificate.
```

### 7]Cipher Suite Confirmation: 
```text
The client sends a message to the server, 
indicating the cipher suite it has selected based on the server's list of supported algorithms. 
This confirms the encryption algorithm and other parameters to be used for the secure connection.
```

### 8]Finished Messages: 
```text
To finalize the handshake, both the client and server send "Finished" messages, 
which are encrypted and include a hash of all the previous handshake messages. 
This step ensures the integrity of the handshake process and 
verifies that both parties can successfully encrypt
and decrypt messages using the agreed-upon session key.
```

Once the TLS handshake is completed successfully, 
the client and server enter a secure connection state, and 
they can exchange data securely using the session key derived during the handshake. 
The data sent and received during this secure connection is encrypted, 
authenticated, and protected from tampering, 
providing confidentiality and integrity for the communication.

DEVICE (IP+MAC) ---> Router-MAC+IP [Device IP+Device MAC] --> 
Router makes Source Mac: device MAC and Destination Mac: Routers MAC 

So when a request is made, the following steps are taken:

1. Request within Local Network (LAN):
    - The device checks if the destination IP address is within the local network.
    - If it is, the device may use ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to find the MAC address corresponding to the destination IP address. This allows direct communication within the LAN.

2. Routing to External Network (Internet):
    - If the destination is outside the local network, the device sends the packet to its default gateway (usually a router).
    - The router examines the destination IP address and makes a routing decision.
    - The router encapsulates the packet in a new Ethernet frame with the source MAC address of the sending device and the destination MAC address of the router's interface connected to the local network.

3. Router's Role:
    - The router receives the packet, updates the source MAC address with its own interface's MAC address, and forwards the packet towards its destination based on its routing table.

4. Internet Routing:
    - The packet traverses the Internet, with routers along the way making routing decisions based on the destination IP address.
    - At each hop, the MAC addresses within the Ethernet frame are updated, but the IP addresses remain constant.

5. Final Destination Network:
    - When the packet reaches the destination network (e.g., the network of a web server), the final router in that network uses ARP to determine the MAC address associated with the destination IP address within its local network.

6. Delivery to Destination Device:
    - The packet is delivered to the destination device within its local network based on the mapping between IP and MAC addresses.

In summary, the process involves checking whether the destination is within the local network. If it is, ARP is used to find the MAC address for direct communication. If the destination is outside the local network, the packet is sent to the router, which encapsulates the packet and forwards it based on IP addresses across the Internet. At each hop, MAC addresses are updated within the Ethernet frame, while IP addresses remain constant for routing decisions.


#

DEVICE (IP+MAC) ---> Router-MAC+IP [Device IP+Device MAC] --> 
Router makes Source Mac: device MAC and Destination Mac: Routers MAC 

so when request is made then first look for ip if ip in lan then find mac
 if not in lan then send to router i.e. gateway router has ip and mac of 
 sender then it stores that mac respective to ip then it forwards this request o 
 internet with same Ip but now mac is changed from devices mac to routers mac 
ChatGPT
Yes, you've captured the process correctly. Let's break down the steps:

Request within Local Network (LAN):

When a device in the local network wants to communicate with another 
device within the same network, it checks whether the destination IP 
address is within the local network.
If the destination is within the local network, the device may use 
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to find the MAC address corresponding 
to the destination IP address. This mapping allows direct communication 
within the LAN.

Routing to External Network (Internet):

If the destination is outside the local network, the device sends 
the packet to its default gateway (usually a router).
The router examines the destination IP address and makes a routing 
decision. It encapsulates the packet in a new Ethernet frame with 
the source MAC address of the sending device and the destination 
MAC address of the router's interface connected to the local network.
Router's Role:

The router receives the packet, updates the source MAC address with 
its own interface's MAC address, and forwards the packet towards 
its destination based on its routing table.


Internet Routing:

The packet traverses the Internet, with routers along the way 
making routing decisions based on the destination IP address.
At each hop, the MAC addresses within the Ethernet frame are 
updated, but the IP addresses remain constant.

Final Destination Network:

When the packet reaches the destination network 
(e.g., the network of a web server), the final router in 
that network uses ARP to determine the MAC address associated
with the destination IP address within its local network.
Delivery to Destination Device:

The packet is delivered to the destination device within its 
local network based on the mapping between IP and MAC addresses.
In summary, the process involves checking whether the 
destination is within the local network. If it is, ARP is 
used to find the MAC address for direct communication. If 
the destination is outside the local network, the packet is 
sent to the router, which encapsulates the packet and forwards 
it based on IP addresses across the Internet. At each hop, MAC 
addresses are updated within the Ethernet frame, while IP 
addresses remain constant for routing decisions.

## Network Layers and Data Encapsulation

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: The Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is referred to as a message or data.
2. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: The data is encapsulated and a port number is added. The PDU is known as a TCP segment or UDP datagram at this stage.
3. **Internet Layer (Network Layer, Layer 3)**: A header containing source and destination IP addresses is added (at router or mobile). The PDU is called a packet. Packets are forwarded on layer 3 devices, such as routers.
4. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: The header contains source and destination MAC addresses. The PDU is referred to as a frame. Frames are forwarded on layer 2 devices, such as switches.
5. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: The data is transmitted as bits (0s and 1s).

#

## 3-0. How Device Finds If Destination Ip In Local Or External Network {#section-3-0}

*📖 [← Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-contents)*

## Q] how device know if destination ip is in local network or external netwrok


### 1. Devices determine whether the destination IP address is within the local 
network or on an external network based on the subnet information and the network 
configuration. This determination is made using the device's subnet mask and 
the concept of network address classes.

Here's a simplified explanation:

### 1] Subnet Information:

- Each device in a network is assigned an IP address along with a subnet mask.
- The subnet mask helps the device identify the network portion and host 
portion of the IP address.

### 2] Local Network vs. External Network:

- If the destination IP address falls within the same network as the sendingdevice (i.e., the network portion of the IP addresses matches), the devices are in the same local network.

- If the destination IP address falls outside the local network 
(i.e., the network portions are different), the destination is considered 
to be on an external network.

### 3] Routing Decision:

- If the destination is within the local network, the device may use ARP to find the MAC address and communicate directly within the local network.
- If the destination is on an external network, the device may need to send the data to a router (gateway) for further routing.

### 4] Default Gateway:

- Devices are often configured with a default gateway (router) that acts as the entry point to reach devices on external networks.
- If the device determines that the destination is external, it forwards the data to the default gateway, which is responsible for routing the data to the appropriate external network.

In summary, the device relies on its knowledge of its own IP address, 
subnet mask, and default gateway to determine whether the destination 
is within the local network or on an external network. 
This information is crucial for making routing decisions and 
efficiently directing data to its intended destination.

Q1]router has two ips internal 
   and external is it right

--> end devices : pc, mobile : 1 IP : Internal ( given By DHCP )
   network devices : routers, Gateways : 2 IP's : Internal + External

Yes, that's correct. In a typical home or office network setup, 
both your PC and your router have two distinct IP addresses:

1) Internal IP Address: by DHCP

The internal IP address is used within your local network. 
It's assigned to each device on your local network to 
communicate with other devices within the same network.
For example, your PC might have an internal IP address 
like 192.168.1.2, and your router might have an internal 
IP address like 192.168.1.1. These addresses are often 
assigned dynamically by a service called DHCP 
(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) or set manually.

2) External (Public) IP Address: by ISP

The external IP address is the address assigned by 
your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to your router. 
This is the IP address that is visible on the internet.
When your devices (like your PC) communicate with the 
outside world (e.g., accessing a website on the internet), 
the communication appears to come from the external IP address 
of your router.Your ISP assigns this external IP address 
dynamically or statically, depending on your service plan.

In summary, the internal IP addresses are used for communication 
within your local network, while the external IP address is used 
for communication with devices on the internet. The router acts 
as a gateway, managing the communication between the internal 
and external networks
----------------------------------------
Q2] I have doubt do end devices like mobile,pc also have 
   internal and external Ip addresses?

End devices, such as mobile phones and personal computers, 
typically have only internal IP addresses within a local 
network. These internal IP addresses are used for 
communication within the local network and are assigned 
by a DHCP server or configured manually.

In a typical home or office network setup:

Internal IP Address:

Each end device, like a mobile phone or a PC, is assigned 
an internal IP address within the local network. This IP 
address is used for communication with other devices 
within the same local network.

For example, an internal IP address could be something like 
192.168.1.2 or another address from the private IP address 
ranges defined by RFC 1918 (e.g., 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x - 
172.31.x.x, or 192.168.x.x).

No External IP Address:

End devices within a local network typically do not have 
external IP addresses. External IP addresses are typically 
assigned to the router or gateway device that connects the 
local network to the broader internet.

Router Acts as Gateway:

When an end device communicates with devices outside the 
local network (e.g., websites on the internet), 
it uses the router as a gateway.
The router, which has both an internal (local) and an 
external (public) IP address, manages the communication 
between the internal devices and the external network.
In summary, while end devices have internal IP addresses 
for local network communication, they rely on the router's 
external IP address when communicating with devices on the 
internet. The router acts as an intermediary, handling the 
translation between internal and external IP addresses.

# DHCP, ARP, NAT in Router

## DHCP: Router Assigns new Internal IPs to Device

The DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) service is typically run by a device on a network called a DHCP server. The DHCP server is responsible for dynamically assigning IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices when they join the network.

Key points about DHCP:

1. **DHCP Server**: The DHCP server can be implemented as a dedicated server on the network or as a feature within network devices like routers and network appliances. In home networks, the router often functions as the DHCP server.
2. **Dynamic Assignment**: When a device connects to the network, it sends a DHCP request to the DHCP server. The DHCP server responds with an available IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, and other configuration parameters.
3. **Lease Duration**: The DHCP server assigns IP addresses for a specific lease duration. After the lease period expires, the device must renew the lease to continue using the same IP address.
4. **Automatic Configuration**: DHCP enables automatic configuration of network parameters, reducing the need for manual configuration on each device.
5. **Network Scalability**: DHCP is particularly useful in larger networks, where managing IP addresses manually for each device would be impractical.

## ARP: Finding MAC in ARP Table in Local Network

The ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table is used for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses within a local network. When a device in the local network wants to communicate with another device, it checks its ARP table to see if it already knows the MAC address associated with the destination device's IP address.

Key points about ARP:

1. **ARP Table**: The ARP table is saved on end devices (mobile, PC) and routers.
2. **ARP Request**: If the MAC address is not in the ARP table, the device broadcasts an ARP request to the local network, asking for the MAC address associated with a specific IP address.
3. **ARP Response**: When the device with the matching IP address receives the ARP request, it responds with its MAC address.
4. **ARP Table Update**: The ARP table is then updated with the IP-to-MAC address mapping, and subsequent communications within the local network can use this mapping to directly address devices.

## NAT: Replacing IP + Port for Communication Between Different Networks

The NAT (Network Address Translation) table is used by routers for Network Address Translation. NAT is primarily involved in translating between private/internal IP addresses used within a local network and a single public/external IP address used for communication with external networks, such as the internet.

Key points about NAT:

1. **NAT Table**: The NAT table keeps track of the mapping between internal private IP addresses and their corresponding external public IP addresses. It may also include information about the associated MAC addresses.
2. **NAT Process**: When a device from the local network communicates with an external server, the router performs NAT to replace the source IP address in the packet with its own external IP address.

Example NAT table entries:

- Device A's NAT table entry: (192.168.1.2, 5001) -> (203.0.113.1, 10001)
- Device B's NAT table entry: (192.168.1.3, 5001) -> (203.0.113.1, 10002) <-- Note the unique port (10002)

----------------------------------------------------------
  DHCP : ROUTER Assigns new Internal IPs TO DEVICE
----------------------------------------------------------
### Q1. who runs DHCP? --> EX: routers runs DHCP to assign IP to device

- The DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) service is 
typically run by a device on a network called a DHCP server. 
The DHCP server is responsible for dynamically assigning 
IP addresses and other network configuration information 
to devices (such as computers, smartphones, and other 
network-connected devices) when they join the network.

- The DHCP server manages a pool of available IP addresses 
and leases them to devices on the network for a specific 
period. This dynamic assignment simplifies network 
administration because devices can join and leave the 
network without requiring manual IP address configuration.

#### Here are the key points about DHCP:

1) DHCP Server:
The DHCP server can be implemented as a dedicated server 
on the network or as a feature within network devices 
like routers and network appliances.
In home networks, the router often functions as the DHCP server.

2) Dynamic Assignment:

   - When a device (such as a computer or smartphone) connects to the network, it sends a DHCP request to the DHCP server.
   - The DHCP server responds with an available IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, and other configuration parameters.
3) Lease Duration:
   - The DHCP server assigns IP addresses for a specific lease duration. After the lease period expires, the device must renew the lease to continue using the same IP address.
4) Automatic Configuration:
   - DHCP enables automatic configuration of network parameters, reducing the need for manual configuration on each device.
5) Network Scalability:
   - DHCP is particularly useful in larger networks, where managing IP addresses manually for each device would be impractical.
   
In summary, the DHCP server plays a crucial role in simplifying the management of IP addresses and other network configuration details on a network. It allows for dynamic and automatic assignment of network parameters to devices, making it easier to scale and administer networks of various sizes.

     ARP :in LOCAL Network finding MAC in ARP table ( MAC: IP ) [ on end devices mobile + Routers ]
---------------
The ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table and the NAT (Network Address Translation) table serve different purposes in networking, and they are associated with different functionalities.
```text
ARP: used in local network to find destination device based on MAC --> ARP Table -> IP : MAC 
```
 
### ARP Table: saved on End devices mobile,pc + Routers 
  
- The ARP table is used for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses within a local network.
- When a device in the local network wants to communicate with another device, it checks its ARP table to see if it already knows the MAC address associated with the destination device's IP address.
- If the MAC address is not in the ARP table, the device broadcasts an ARP request to the local network, asking for the MAC address associated with a specific IP address.
- When the device with the matching IP address receives the ARP request, it responds with its MAC address.
- The ARP table is then updated with the IP-to-MAC address mapping, and subsequent communications within the local network can use this mapping to directly address devices.
NAT Table:

     NAT : replacing IP + PORT for communcation between different networks only
--------------------

### NAT: used when communication is between different network

- The NAT table is used by routers for Network Address Translation.
- NAT is primarily involved in translating between private/internal IP addresses used within a local network and a single public/external IP address used for communication with external networks, such as the internet.
- The NAT table keeps track of the mapping between internal private IP addresses and their corresponding external public IP addresses. It may also include information about the associated MAC addresses.
- When a device from the local network communicates with an external server, the router performs NAT to replace the source IP address in the packet with its own external IP address.
- In summary, the ARP table maps IP addresses to MAC addresses within a local network, facilitating local communication. On the other hand, the NAT table maps private internal IP addresses to a single external IP address for communication with external networks, helping conserve public IP addresses and enabling multiple devices within a local network to share a single external IP address. While both tables involve address mapping, they serve different purposes in the context of local network communication and external network communication, respectively.


### Assume the following:

Device A initiates communication and gets assigned external port 10001.
Device B initiates communication simultaneously and also gets assigned external port 10001.
Now, the NAT table entries would look like this:
```text
Device A's NAT table entry: (192.168.1.2, 5001) -> (203.0.113.1, 10001)
Device B's NAT table entry: (192.168.1.3, 5001) -> (203.0.113.1, 10002) <-- Note the unique port (10002)

## 3-1. Do Router Uses Arp {#section-3-1}

*📖 [← Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-contents)*

# Do router uses ARP 
ChatGPT
Yes, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used by 
routers in certain situations, 
particularly within the local network or subnet. 
ARP is employed to map an IP address to its 
corresponding MAC address within the same network.

### Here's how ARP is typically used by a router within a local network:

#### 1. Local Network Communication:

- When a router receives a packet that is destined for 
another device within the same local network, it may 
need to determine the MAC address associated with 
the destination IP address.
If the MAC address is not already known, the router 
uses ARP to discover it.

#### 2. ARP Request:

- The router sends out an ARP request broadcast to 
the local network, asking, "Who has this IP address?"
The ARP request contains the IP address for which 
the router is seeking the corresponding MAC address.
Device with Matching IP Responds:

- The device on the local network that has the matching 
IP address responds with its MAC address.
This ARP response is unicast back to the router.
ARP Table Update:

- The router updates its ARP table with the MAC address 
associated with the IP address.
Subsequent Communication:

- With the MAC address now known, the router can use it 
to construct frames for local communication within the network.
- It's important to note that ARP is primarily used 
within the local network to resolve IP addresses to 
MAC addresses. When a router is forwarding packets 
between different networks, it doesn't use ARP to 
discover the MAC address of a remote device or router. 
Instead, the router uses its own MAC address as the 
source MAC address and forwards the packet based on 
its routing table.

So, while ARP is an essential part of local network 
communication, its usage is limited to resolving MAC 
addresses within the same subnet.

```
ChatGPT
Your breakdown is quite accurate, but I would like to make a few clarifications and corrections:

### Device Obtains IP from DHCP:

- When a device joins a network, it typically sends a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) request to the router.
The DHCP server in the router assigns an internal IP address to the device based on its MAC address.
The router maintains a DHCP lease table that associates MAC addresses with assigned internal IP addresses.
Device Communicates with an External Site:

- When the device sends a packet to an external site, the packet contains the source IP address (the internal IP assigned by DHCP) and the device's MAC address.
The router performs Network Address Translation (NAT), replacing the source IP address with its own external IP address (assigned by the ISP). The MAC address is not changed in this process.
The router creates a frame with the device's MAC address as the source MAC and its own external IP address as the source IP, and it forwards this frame to the ISP.
ISP Routes the Packet to the Destination Site:

- The ISP receives the packet, sees the destination IP address (the external IP of the router), and routes it accordingly to reach the destination site's server.
Response from Site to Device:

- The response from the site's server has a destination IP address set to the external IP address of the router (assigned by the ISP).
- The ISP routes the response packet to the router based on the destination IP.
- he router, using its NAT table, determines the internal IP address associated with the original device's MAC address.
- The router replaces the destination IP address in the packet with the internal IP address and forwards it to the device within the local network.
- Regarding the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), it is typically used within a local network to map an IP address to a MAC address. In the scenario of receiving a response from the internet, the router uses its NAT table to determine the internal IP address associated with the MAC address of the device, and no ARP is involved in this process.

Your understanding of the flow is generally correct, and these processes are fundamental to how devices communicate on a network, especially when dealing with private/internal IP addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) for communication with the internet.

--------------
# So ARP only used in local network while NAT used when communication is with external networks?
-------------------

Yes, that's correct. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and NAT (Network Address Translation) serve different purposes in networking and are typically used in different contexts:

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):

- ARP is used within a local network to map an IP address to a corresponding MAC address.
- When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same local network, it uses ARP to discover the MAC address associated with the IP address.
- ARP requests are broadcast within the local network, and the device with the corresponding IP address responds with its MAC address.
### NAT (Network Address Translation):

- NAT is used when a device within a local network wants to communicate with devices on external networks, such as the internet.
- The router, acting as a NAT device, replaces the source IP address in outgoing packets with its own external IP address. This process allows multiple devices within the local network to share a single external IP address.
- When responses are received from external networks, the router uses its NAT table to determine the internal IP address to which the response should be forwarded.
- In summary, ARP is used for address resolution within a local network, ensuring that devices can communicate with each other using their MAC addresses. NAT, on the other hand, is employed for communication between devices within a local network and external networks, providing a way for multiple devices to share a single external IP address and facilitating communication over the internet.


-------------------
 
## Scenario 1: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) - IN LOCAL Network

#### 1] Device Joins Local Network:

- new device (Device A) joins a local network and requests an IP address from the router through DHCP.
The router, acting as a DHCP server, assigns an internal IP address to Device A.
Device A Communicates with Another Local Device (Device B):

#### 2] Device A wants to communicate with another device (Device B) on the same local network.
- Device A sends an ARP broadcast to discover the MAC address associated with the internal IP address of Device B.
Device B responds to the ARP request, providing its MAC address to Device A.
#### 3] Communication Between Devices A and B:

- Now that Device A knows the MAC address of Device B, it can construct packets addressed to Device B using the Link layer information (MAC addresses).
In this scenario, ARP is crucial for devices within the same local network to discover each other's MAC addresses associated with their IP addresses.


## Scenario 2: NAT (Network Address Translation)

#### 1. Device Sends Packet to External Server:

- Device A, with an internal IP address, initiates communication with an external server on the internet.
The router, using NAT, replaces the source IP address in the packet with its own external IP address.
Communication with the External Server:

- The router forwards the packet to the external server using its external IP address.
The external server responds to the router's external IP address.
#### 2. Router Translates the Response Using NAT:

- When the response packet arrives at the router, NAT is used to determine the internal IP address (Device A) associated with the original communication.
- The router replaces the destination IP address in the response packet with the internal IP address of Device A and forwards it within the local network.
- In this scenario, NAT is employed to allow multiple devices within the local network to share a single external IP address for communication with external servers on the internet.


-------------------
# So when device makes first time connection with router it stores mac with assigned internal ip in NAT table
-------------------


- Yes, that's correct. When a device makes its initial connection to the router, particularly through a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) process, the router maintains a NAT (Network Address Translation) table that associates the device's MAC address with the internal IP address assigned to it.

- Here's a simplified overview of the process:

#### Device Joins the Network:

- A new device connects to the local network, and it may request an IP address from the router through DHCP.
Router Assigns Internal IP:

- The router, acting as a DHCP server, assigns a unique internal IP address to the device based on its MAC address.
NAT Table Entry Created:

- The router creates an entry in its NAT table that associates the MAC address of the device with the internal IP address assigned to it.
Device Communication with External Network:

- When the device communicates with external servers or devices on the internet, the router uses NAT to replace the source IP address in outgoing packets with its own external IP address.
#### Router Forwards Packets and Manages NAT Table:

- The router forwards the packets to the external network, and the NAT table helps keep track of the association between internal IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses.
Handling Responses:

- When responses from the external network arrive at the router, the NAT table is consulted to determine the appropriate internal IP address (and associated MAC address) to forward the response to within the local network.
- In this way, the NAT table helps the router manage the translation between internal and external IP addresses, allowing multiple devices within the local network to share a single external IP address for communication with the external network. The NAT table is dynamic and is continuously updated as devices join or leave the network.

Always remember: For a frame, both IP (for packet) and MAC are always necessary. A frame cannot be sent over local or external network if MAC and IP are unknown.
-----
## Device to Device Communication in Internal Network

1. A device, when it needs to communicate with another, first searches in its ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table for the MAC address associated with the IP of the target device.
2. If the MAC address is not found, the device broadcasts a request to all devices in the local network asking for the MAC address associated with the target IP.
3. Once the MAC address is received, it is updated in the ARP (IP:MAC)table.
4. The device then creates a packet (at Network layer-3) and a frame (at Link layer-2) using the MAC address.
5. The frame is sent to the target device.
6. Upon receiving a response from the target device, the source IP is replaced with the destination IP to complete the response.

------
## Role of MAC and IP in Internal Network Communication

Communication within an internal network typically involves both MAC addresses and IP addresses. Here's how they work together to facilitate the exchange of data between devices:

### MAC Addresses (Data Link Layer - Layer 2)

- MAC addresses are used for communication within the local network.
- Devices on the same local network use MAC addresses to address frames to each other.

### IP Addresses (Network Layer - Layer 3)

- IP addresses are used for logical addressing and end-to-end communication across networks.
- Devices use IP addresses to route packets between different networks.
- In an internal network, IP addresses are crucial for devices to identify each other and communicate logically.

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

- ARP is used within a local network to map an IP address to its corresponding MAC address.
- When a device needs to communicate with another device on the same local network and it knows the destination IP address but not the MAC address, it uses ARP to discover the MAC address associated with that IP address.

In summary, internal network communication involves both MAC addresses and IP addresses. Devices within the same local network use MAC addresses to address frames for direct communication, and ARP helps resolve the mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses when needed.

However, in some scenarios, local communication might be facilitated solely by MAC addresses, especially in non-IP-based networks or specific network configurations. In modern networks that use IP, the combination of MAC and IP addresses is the standard for efficient and logical communication within and between networks.

## ARP Process

1. **Device A wants to communicate with Device B**: Device A knows the IP address of Device B and wants to send data to it within the local network.
2. **ARP Request**: Device A checks its ARP table to see if it already knows the MAC address associated with the IP address of Device B. If the MAC address is not in the ARP table, Device A broadcasts an ARP request on the local network, asking, "Who has the IP address of Device B?"
3. **Device B Responds**: Device B, recognizing its IP address in the ARP request, replies with its MAC address. This ARP response is unicast back to Device A.
4. **ARP Table Update**: Device A updates its ARP table with the MAC address of Device B, associating it with the known IP address.
5. **Data Transmission**: Now that Device A has the MAC address of Device B, it can construct a frame with the data and destination MAC address. The frame is then transmitted over the local network to Device B based on the MAC address.

In this way, ARP helps devices within the same local network discover each other's MAC addresses based on their IP addresses. Once the MAC address is known, devices can efficiently communicate through data frames within the local network.

It's important to note that ARP is specific to local networks, and it operates at the link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It facilitates communication within a single broadcast domain or local subnet.

do communcation in internal network happen using only 
mac and independent of IP

Communication within an internal network typically 
involves both MAC addresses and IP addresses, and the 
two work together to facilitate the exchange of data 
between devices. Let's break down how these addresses 
are used in internal network communication:

MAC Addresses (at the Data Link Layer - Layer 2):

MAC addresses are used at the Data Link layer for 
communication within the local network.
Devices on the same local network use MAC addresses 
to address frames to each other.
When a device wants to communicate with another device 
within the same local network, it uses the destination 
device's MAC address in the frame.

IP Addresses (at the Network Layer - Layer 3):

IP addresses are used at the Network layer for logical 
addressing and end-to-end communication across networks.
Devices use IP addresses to route packets between different networks.
In an internal network, IP addresses are crucial 
for devices to identify each other and communicate logically.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):

ARP is a protocol used within a local network to map an 
IP address to its corresponding MAC address.
When a device needs to communicate with another device 
on the same local network and it knows the destination 
IP address but not the MAC address, it uses ARP to 
discover the MAC address associated with that IP address.
In summary, internal network communication involves 
both MAC addresses and IP addresses. Devices within the 
same local network use MAC addresses to address frames 
for direct communication, and ARP helps resolve the 
mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses when needed.

However, it's worth noting that in some scenarios, local 
communication might be facilitated solely by MAC addresses, 
especially in non-IP-based networks or specific network 
configurations. In modern networks that use IP, the combination 
of MAC and IP addresses is the standard for efficient and 
logical communication within and between networks.

## Process [How device communcates in Same Network ]


1] Device A wants to communicate with Device B:
    Device A knows the IP address of Device B and wants to send data 
    to it within the local network.

2] ARP Request:
    Device A checks its ARP table to see if it already knows the 
    MAC address associated with the IP address of Device B.
    If the MAC address is not in the ARP table, Device A broadcasts an 
    ARP request on the local network, asking, "Who has the IP address of Device B?"

3] Device B Responds:
    Device B, recognizing its IP address in the ARP request, 
    replies with its MAC address.
    This ARP response is unicast back to Device A.

4] ARP Table Update:
    Device A updates its ARP table with the MAC address of Device B, 
    associating it with the known IP address.

5] Data Transmission:
    Now that Device A has the MAC address of Device B, it can 
    construct a frame with the data and destination MAC address.
    The frame is then transmitted over the local network to 
    Device B based on the MAC address.

In this way, ARP helps devices within the same local network 
discover each other's MAC addresses based on their IP addresses. 
Once the MAC address is known, devices can efficiently communicate 
through data frames within the local network.

It's important to note that ARP is specific to local networks, and 
it operates at the link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It facilitates 
communication within a single broadcast domain or local subnet.

## 5. External Network {#section-5}

*📖 [← Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-contents)*

# Communication with External Network

## 1) Device Obtains IP from Router

1. The device (with its MAC address) sends a request to the router, which has both an internal and external IP address.
2. The router assigns a new internal IP address to the device using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
3. The router saves the association between the device's MAC address and the new internal IP address in its ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table.
4. The router then sends the new internal IP address back to the device.

## 2) Device Sends Request to Router

1. The device determines the destination IP address using DNS (Domain Name System).
2. The device, with its internal IP address (e.g., 10.0.0.2/24:8080), creates a packet at the transport layer. This packet includes the HTTP data and is sent using either TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
3. The packet includes both the source IP and destination IP, but does not include the MAC address.
4. The device sends the packet to the router.

## 3) Router Forwards Request to Next-Hop Router or ISP

1. The router determines whether the destination device is in the internal or external network based on the subnet mask.
2. The router uses NAT (Network Address Translation) to change the original source IP of the packet to its public IP address given by the ISP. This is maintained in the NAT table with a specific port (e.g., 10.0.0.2/24:8080 --> 196.68.10.1:3000).
3. The router adds the source MAC (its own MAC address) and the destination MAC (the MAC address of the next-hop router or the ISP's router).
4. The router then sends the packet to the ISP or the next-hop router.

## 4) Destination Server Sends Response

1. The destination server sends a response to the ISP or the next-hop router.

## 5) Router Receives Response

1. The router receives the response and uses NAT to map the source IP and port back to the original internal IP of the device.
2. The router then sends the response to the device's internal IP address.

## 6) Response Process

The response process is not detailed in the selected content. However, typically, upon receiving the response, the device would process the data as needed (e.g., rendering a web page in a browser).

---------------------------------------------------------
   B] With External Network
---------------------------------------------------------
```
1) Device gets IP from Router: ( DHCP )
    Device ( with MAC)---> Router (have Internal + External Ip )
    --> Router assign new Internal Ip to Device by DHCP 
    --> ROuter saves MAC : Internal Ip  - In ARP Table
    --> Router gives Back new Internal IP to device

2) Device request to Router:
    --> find destination IP : DNS
    --> Device (Internal Ip e.x. 10.0.0.2/24:8080)
    --> Making of Packet in device -Transport layer : TCP or UDP [ HTTP + DATA ]
    --> PAcket : adds both source IP and destination- IP : NO MAC 
    --> send packet to Router

3)  Router to Next-Hop Router or ISP
    --> Router decides device in Internal or External Network 
        based on SUBNET Mask
    --> Router uses NAT ( 10.0.0.2/24:8080-->196.68.10.1:3000 ) 
        changes original source IP of packet
    --> to it's Public Ip given by ISP and maintains it 
        in NAT table with specific PORT
    --> Router adds source MAC ( self mac ) and 
        destination MAC ( this is of NEXT-Hop router - ISP's router) 
    --> to ISP/ to other NEXT-HOP Router

4) to Destination 
    --> destination server - Response 
    --> to ISP/ to other NEXT-HOP Router

5) Response
    --> to Router --> NAT to source IP and PORT ( revere mapping )
    --> to internal IP of Device ( from Router )

6) Response Process:

# 📡 Packet Routing Process

This document describes the process of routing a packet from a source device (**Device A**) to a destination device, explaining the role of key tables and the step-by-step journey of a packet.

---

## **🗂 Key Tables Involved**

### 1️⃣ **MAC Address Table**
- Maps **MAC address → Port** (**Layer 2: Data Link Layer**)  
- Found in **Switches, Mobile devices, Laptops**

### 2️⃣ **ARP Table**
- Maps **IP address → MAC Address** (**Layer 2: Data Link Layer**)  
- Found in **Routers, Mobile devices, Laptops**

### 3️⃣ **Routing Table**
- Maps **IP address → Next Hop IP Address** (**Layer 3: Network Layer**)  
- Found in **Routers**

---

## **🌍 Packet Creation and Routing Process**

### **1️⃣ Packet Creation**
```text
Device A (Mobile) creates a packet: 
  - Finds the destination IP using DNS
  - Creates packet [ Source IP → Destination IP ] (Layer 3)
```

### **2️⃣ MAC Address Discovery (Using ARP)**
```text
Device A (Mobile) → Needs MAC address of next hop 
  - Broadcasts ARP Request to all devices in the network
  - Router registers Device A's IP & MAC in ARP Table
  - Router sends ARP Response back to Device A
  - Device A saves ARP response in its ARP Table
```

### **3️⃣ Frame Creation & Sending to Router**
```text
Device A creates a Frame: 
  - Adds MAC addresses (Layer 2: Data Link Layer)
  - Frame contains [ Source MAC → Destination MAC (Router) ]
  - Sends Frame to Router
```

### **4️⃣ Router Processing the Frame**
```text
Router verifies the IP Address: 
  - Checks if the destination IP is in the local network
  - If local, sends ARP request to find MAC of the destination
  - If remote, sends ARP request to next hop (ISP or another router)

Router updates ARP Table: 
  - Saves MAC of the destination or next-hop router
  - Adds Layer 2 headers [ Router MAC as Source → Next Hop MAC as Destination ]
  - Forwards frame to the appropriate network path
```

### **5️⃣ Frame Forwarding to Destination**
```text
Switch receives the frame:
  - Uses MAC Address Table to determine the correct port
  - Forwards the frame to the correct port/device

Destination Device (Receiver):
  - Receives the frame
  - Strips Layer 2 headers
  - Reads Layer 3 data (IP header) to process the packet
```

---

## **🔄 Response Process (Reverse Flow)**

### **1️⃣ Destination Creates Response Packet**
```text
Destination Device creates a response packet:
  - Adds [ Source IP → Destination IP ] (Layer 3)
  - Determines if the destination is local or remote
```

### **2️⃣ MAC Discovery & Routing Back**
```text
Destination Device checks ARP Table:
  - Broadcasts ARP request to find the MAC of the Router
  - Router responds with its MAC Address
  - Destination Device updates its ARP & MAC Tables

Creates Frame:
  - Adds Layer 2 data: [ Source MAC → Router MAC ]
  - Sends Frame to Router
```

### **3️⃣ Router Forwards Response Packet**
```text
Router receives frame:
  - Strips Layer 2 headers
  - Checks Routing Table for next-hop IP
  - Broadcasts ARP request if necessary to find MAC of next hop
  - Updates ARP and Routing Tables
  - Adds new Layer 2 headers (Router MAC → Next Hop MAC)
  - Forwards frame towards the source device (Device A)
```

### **4️⃣ Final Delivery to Source Device**
```text
Switch processes the MAC Address:
  - Forwards the response to the correct port

Device A (Source Device) receives the response:
  - Strips Layer 2 and Layer 3 headers
  - Extracts the data payload
```

## **📌 Key Takeaways**
✔ **Layer 3 (IP) decides the route, but Layer 2 (MAC) delivers the packet hop by hop**.  
✔ **Routers update their ARP and Routing Tables dynamically**.  
✔ **MAC addresses are used only within a local network; IP addresses are used across networks**.  
✔ **Switches use MAC tables; routers use Routing Tables to forward packets**.  
✔ **ARP is used to resolve MAC addresses before sending packets**.  
✔ **Routers strip Layer 2 data and add new MAC addresses at each hop**.  

---

## **🔐 Security Aspects**
🔹 **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: ARP Spoofing can mislead devices into sending packets to an attacker instead of the router.  
🔹 **Packet Sniffing**: Unencrypted data can be intercepted between hops. HTTPS (TLS encryption) prevents this.  
🔹 **Firewalls & Packet Filtering**: Firewalls analyze packets at Layer 3 & 4 to block malicious traffic.

---

## **🚀 Optimizations in Packet Routing**
🔹 **Caching ARP Entries**: Reduces ARP requests to improve network performance.  
🔹 **Load Balancing**: Routers distribute packets across multiple paths to prevent congestion.  
🔹 **Fast Reroute (FRR)**: Provides immediate backup paths for critical networks.

# Introduction to Network

## Network Components

1. **End Nodes**: These include compute, storage, and management nodes. They serve as the source or destination nodes.
2. **Intermediate Nodes**: These are switches and routers. They receive traffic generated from end nodes and decide where to forward the traffic.

## Connection of Network Components

Network components are connected using hardware Network Interface Cards (NICs) and cables.

## Communication Between Nodes

Communication between two nodes happens through a protocol suite, which is a group of protocols that run concurrently to implement network communication. Each protocol defines a common format and a set of rules for exchanging messages between devices.

## Network Models

- OSI Model
- TCP/IP Model

## Encapsulation of Data

At each layer of the network model, data is encapsulated and a header is added. There can be encoding, decoding, or formatting at different layers.

## Protocol Data Units (PDUs)
```text
Encapsulated data at each layer is referred to as a Protocol Data Unit (PDU). Examples of PDUs include packets, segments, datagrams, or frames. Each layer in the OSI model is associated with different protocols, PDUs, addresses, and devices.
```

- **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: The PDU is referred to as a message or data.
- **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: The data is encapsulated and a port number is added. The PDU is known as a TCP segment or UDP datagram at this stage.
- **Internet Layer (Network Layer, Layer 3)**: A header containing source and destination IP addresses is added (at router or mobile). The PDU is called a packet. Packets are forwarded on layer 3 devices, such as routers.
- **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: The header contains source and destination MAC addresses. The PDU is referred to as a frame. Frames are forwarded on layer 2 devices, such as switches.
- **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: The data is transmitted as bits (0s and 1s).

### 1. Packet To Destiantion {#section-1}

> **📁 Topic: Packet Tracing**

# Packet Routing Process

This document describes the process of routing a packet from a source device (Device A) to a destination device.

## Key Tables Involved

1. **MAC Address Table**: Maps MAC address to port (Layer 2: Data Link Layer, e.g., Switch, Mobile, Laptop)
2. **ARP Table**: Maps IP address to MAC Address (Layer 2 - Data link layer, e.g., Router/Mobile/Laptop)
3. **Routing Table**: Maps IP address to IP address (Layer 3 - Network Layer, e.g., Router)

## Packet Creation and Routing

1. **Packet Creation**: Device A (Mobile) creates a packet. It finds the destination IP using DNS and creates a packet with the source and destination IP addresses (Layer 3).

2. **MAC Address Discovery**: Device A broadcasts an ARP request to all devices in the network. The router registers Device A's IP and MAC addresses in its ARP table and sends back an ARP response to Device A. Device A saves this response in its ARP table.

3. **Frame Creation**: Device A creates a frame by adding the MAC addresses (Layer 2: TCP/IP: Data Link Layer) to the packet. It then sends this frame to the router.

4. **Frame Processing by Router**: The router verifies the IP and decides using the subnet if the IP is local or not. The router removes the Layer 2 data (source and destination MAC addresses) but not Layer 3. If the router doesn't have the MAC of the destination, it broadcasts an ARP request. The destination device sends back an ARP response in unicast. Both the destination device and the router update their ARP tables.

5. **Frame Completion and Forwarding**: The router adds Layer 3 data (its MAC as the source and the receiver's MAC as the destination) to complete the frame. It then forwards the frame to the switch, which processes the MAC and the respective port. The switch forwards the received message to the port.

6. **Packet Reception by Destination Device**: The destination device strips Layer 2 and then Layer 3 data to recover the original data.

## Response Process

The response process follows the same steps in reverse. 
- The destination device creates a packet with the source and destination IP addresses. 
- It checks if the IP is local or not and broadcasts an ARP message to find the MAC of the router. 
- The router receives the request, refreshes its ARP table data, and sends a unicast ARP response. 
- The destination device saves the MAC and IP of the router in its ARP table and also updates its MAC table. 
- It then creates a frame and sends it to the router. 
- The router checks the destination IP by subnet to decide if it's local or not, strips the Layer 2 data, broadcasts an ARP request to find the MAC of the next hop router or ISP, gets the ARP response, updates its ARP and routing tables or NAT table, adds Layer 3 data to the packet, and forwards it to the next hop or ISP.

# 3 Tables:

### 1) MAC address tables : 
- maps MAC address to PORT ( Layer 2: Data Link Layer, EX. Switch, Mobile,Laptop)
### 2) ARP Table : 
- Maps IP address : MAC Address (Layer 2 - Data link layer , Ex. Router/Mobile/Laptop)
### 3) Routing Table : 
- IP address : IP address ( layer 3 - network Layer , Ex. ROuter)

-------------------------------------------------

## MAC Address Table : in Mobile
## ARP Table : in Mobile
## Routing Table : In ROuter
## IP address : provided by ISP
-------------------------------

### 1) create packet:
```text
Device A (Mobile )--> create packet : find destination IP - DNS 
--> create packet [ source IP : destination IP ] : layer 3
```

### 2) find MAC address to create frame :

```text
Device A from PORT (SWITCH - MAC Table ) 
--> broadcast ARP Request 
--> to all devices in Network 
--> ARP : Device A MAC + IP 
--> Router registers in ARP Table [ Device A IP : MAC ]
--> Router Sends Back ARP Response [ MAC and IP of Router ]
--> TO device A 
--> Device A saves ARP response in Device A'a ARP Table 
--> Device A creates Frame : add MAC  [LAyer 2: TCP/IP:DATA Link Layer] to packet [ source MAC : destination MAC]
--> send Frame to Router
--> ROuter verifies IP and decides using subnet if IP in local or not
--> Router Removes L2 data ( source MAC : destination MAC) - NOT L3
--> Router needed to complete Frame
--> if Router don't have MAC of destination it broadcasts ARP and 
   device sends back ARP Response in unicast [MAC address ]
   { 
      It's essential to clarify that ARP requests and responses are typically broadcast
    within the local network segment. Routers do not forward ARP broadcasts across different network segments.
}
--> destination updates ARP table 
--> on Receving response Router updates ARP table
--> ADDS L3 [ Routers MAC as source : destination MAC as receivers MAC]
--> frame is complete 
--> forward frame to SWITCH (device) it Processes MAC and Respective Port 
--> SWITCH forwards Recevied msg to PORT 
--> destination Device Stips L2 and then L3 and recovers Data
<-- back same Process for response 
<-- decide if ip is in local or not
<-- create packet [ Layer 3 : add source and destination Ip]
<-- now check if is in local or not
<-- broadcast ARP msg to find MAC of ROuter
<-- Router receives Request 
<-- Refresh ARP table Data
<-- unicast ARP Response [ MAC address + IP Address]
<-- destination Device Saves MAC + IP of ROuter In ARP table
<-- also MAC table [ Router MAC:Port_for_Router]
<-- create frame : Add L3 [ source mac:destination_device MAC and destination:Routers_MAC]
<-- frame to Router
<-- Router check destination IP by subnet to decide in local or not
<-- Router strips L2 [ mac]
<-- broadcast ARP to find MAC of next hop router of ISP
<-- Gets Response ARP updates ARP table and Routing Tables or NAT Table
<-- ADDs L3 to packet 
<-- forward to next hop or ISP

### 2. Tcp Http Mulipart Upload {#section-2}

> **📁 Topic: Examples**

# 🚀 How HTTP Works with Multipart Form-Data Uploads (Behind the Scenes of TCP & HTTP)

When you upload a large file (e.g., a **100MB MP4**) using `multipart/form-data`, it might seem like the entire file is sent as one **big chunk**, but in reality, the **internet breaks it down into smaller pieces** before it reaches the target server. Let’s go deep into **how HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP handle large uploads**.

---

## **1️⃣ User Initiates an HTTP Upload Request**
### 📌 Example HTTP Upload Request (Using `multipart/form-data`)
```http
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary123
Content-Length: 100000000  # (100MB file)

------WebKitFormBoundary123
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="video.mp4"
Content-Type: video/mp4

(binary file data here...)
------WebKitFormBoundary123--
```
🔹 This looks like a **single request**, but behind the scenes, it’s **split into small chunks**.

---

## **2️⃣ How TCP Breaks Data into Packets**
Once the browser starts sending this HTTP request, the **underlying transport layer (TCP) steps in to break the data into smaller packets** for transmission over the internet.

### 📌 How TCP Segments Large Data (100MB File Example)
```
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Full 100MB File (as seen in HTTP request)                |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  TCP Segments (MSS ~1460 bytes per packet)                |
|  ├── Packet 1: 1460 bytes                                 |
|  ├── Packet 2: 1460 bytes                                 |
|  ├── Packet 3: 1460 bytes                                 |
|  ├── ...                                                 |
|  ├── Packet 68556: Last Packet (~700 bytes)              |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```
🔹 **Why does TCP split the data?**  
- **Max Segment Size (MSS) ≈ 1460 bytes per packet** (depends on MTU - Max Transmission Unit).  
- **TCP breaks the large 100MB file into thousands of small packets** for transmission.  
- Each **packet has a sequence number**, so they can be **reassembled at the server**.  

---

## **3️⃣ How HTTP Data Moves Over the Internet**
Each of these **TCP packets is then sent over the internet** from the user’s computer to the destination server via **multiple routers, switches, and networks**.

### 📌 Visualization of HTTP Data Traveling Over the Internet
```
+--------------------------------------------------------+
|  User's Browser Sends HTTP POST (100MB File)          |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
|  TCP Splits Data into Small Packets (1460 bytes each) |

🔹 **Important Points:**  
- TCP **ensures all packets arrive in the correct order** (even if they take different routes).  
- If a packet **gets lost**, TCP **requests a retransmission**.  
- HTTP **only sees the reassembled file**, while **TCP handles all the packetization work**.

## **4️⃣ How HTTPS Encrypts Data Over TCP (TLS Layer)**
If HTTPS (`https://`) is used instead of HTTP:
- The **entire HTTP request is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security)**.
- Each TCP packet **contains encrypted data**, so even if intercepted, it can’t be read.

### 📌 Visualization of HTTPS Data Transfer
```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  User Sends HTTPS POST (100MB File)             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  TLS Encrypts HTTP Request                      |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  TCP Splits Encrypted Data into Packets         |
|  ├── Packet 1 (Encrypted)                       |
|  ├── Packet 2 (Encrypted)                       |
|  ├── ...                                        |
|  ├── Packet 68556 (Encrypted)                   |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```
🔹 **Why is HTTPS important?**
- **Prevents packet sniffing & MITM attacks** (since data is encrypted before TCP handles it).
- **Ensures file integrity** (prevents tampering).

---

## **5️⃣ Server Receives and Reassembles the Data**
Once all packets arrive:
- **TCP reassembles them into the original HTTP request**.
- **The server reads the `multipart/form-data` payload** and extracts the file.

### 📌 Visualization of Server Processing
```
+------------------------------------------------------+
|  Server Receives TCP Packets                        |

|  TCP Reassembles Data                               |
|  ├── Packet 1 → Packet 2 → ... → Last Packet      |
+------------------------------------------------------+
|  HTTP Server Extracts File from Multipart Request  |
+------------------------------------------------------+
|  File is Stored (e.g., S3, Local Disk, DB)         |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

## **🔹 Summary of How HTTP Uploads Work Over TCP**
| **Step** | **Process** |
|----------|------------|
| **User Uploads File** | Browser sends `multipart/form-data` request with file. |
| **TCP Splits Data** | TCP breaks the file into small packets (~1460 bytes each). |
| **Data Travels Over Internet** | Packets take different routes but are reassembled at the server. |
| **Server Receives Packets** | TCP reassembles the file, and HTTP server processes the request. |
| **File is Stored** | The extracted file is stored in **S3, local disk, or DB**. |

---

## **🔹 Key Takeaways**
✔ **HTTP doesn’t send files as one big chunk** – TCP **splits it into small packets**.  
✔ **HTTPS encrypts the data before TCP handles it**.  
✔ **If a packet is lost, TCP resends it** (ensuring reliability).  
✔ **Internet routers handle packets separately** (they might not arrive in order).  
✔ **The server waits for all packets, then reconstructs the file**.

### 2. Tcp Ip {#section-2}

> **📁 Topic: Nvidia coursera network**

# Welcome to TCP/IP Protocol Suite Course

In this course, we will introduce some of the most used TCP/IP protocols from a top-down perspective. 

## Course Outline

1. **Application Layer Protocols**: We will start with application layer protocols such as HTTP and FTP.
2. **Transport Layer Protocols**: Next, we will move on to TCP and UDP.
3. **Internet Layer Protocol**: Lastly, we will present IP, the Internet layer protocol, and some supplemental IP services that are crucial to IP-based networks.

Remember, the main goal of having a network is data transfer.

## Understanding Application Communication

Let's see how it works. We have two remote applications that generate messages, and these messages are exchanged between the two applications. For the applications to understand each other, they must implement the same protocol.

### Example: Web Browser and Server

One example of this concept would be using a web browser to view web pages. On one end, the application is the web browser, and on the other end, the application is the web server. When the user inserts the web page address in the browser's address bar, in the background, it is converted to a request in a format that the web server can understand. Once the request is received by the server, it responds with page details in a format that the browser can present in text or links.

### Application Layer Protocols

There are many different applications with different purposes and requirements. For each application, there is an application layer protocol that provides the interface to the networking services. Whenever an application layer protocol wishes to communicate with a remote application, it hands over the data to the transport layer.

### Transport Layer Protocols

Some application layer protocols use TCP as the transport layer, while others prefer UDP. More information on TCP and UDP will be provided in the next section.

We have previously used the example of a web browser asking for a web page from a web server. For the communication between the two to happen, both the web browser and server must implement the same application layer protocol. This protocol is called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which allows the exchange of text and hyperlinks. It also has a secure variant called HTTPS. HTTP functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content types, and returns a responding message to the client. The response contains the request completion status information and may also contain requested content in its message body.

## FTP Protocol

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol used to transfer files between hosts. FTP users may connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it, or may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username or password. FTPs can be used for secure transmission that protects the username and password and also encrypts the content.

## Transport Layer Protocols

For communication between two applications to happen, the messages are formatted into an application layer protocol. The next step is for the application layer protocol to ask transport layer services. Transport layer protocols are responsible for establishing end-to-end logical communication channels between the source application and the destination application. The functions of the transport layer are facilitating the communicating hosts to carry on a conversation, providing an interface for the users to the underlying network. If needed, it can provide a reliable connection. It can also carry out error checking, flow control, and verification. The two most commonly used protocols are TCP and UDP.

### TCP Protocol

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable connection-oriented transport protocol. Connection-oriented means that a connection is established between the peer entities prior to transmission. To assure data transfer reliability, TCP uses sequence numbers and acknowledgments to recover from damaged or lost data. Another important mechanism provided by the TCP is flow control. The flow control allows a busy receiver to govern the amount of data sent by the sender. TCP uses a window size to indicate the allowed number of bytes the sender may transit before receiving further permission. Lastly, TCP sequence numbers are used to order segments, hence providing order delivery. All those mechanisms have multiple advantages and indeed, many applications that require reliability use TCP as their transport layer protocol. However, there is a trade-off as it is associated with overhead, and therefore data transfer slows down.

### TCP Connection Management

For applications that require fast lightweight transport service, TCP may not be the best choice. When a client needs to connect to a remote server using TCP, first, a connection must be established. Once a connection is established, data can be transferred. TCP uses a keep-alive feature to keep connections open and manage them. The keep-alive feature verifies that the peer at the other end of a connection is still available. After the data is transmitted, the session is terminated and the allocated resources are released.
## TCP/IP Network Connection: Three-way Handshake

A three-way handshake is a method used in a TCP/IP network to create a connection between peers. It is a three-step method designed to allow both communicating ends to initiate and negotiate the parameters of their connection before data such as HTTP and SSH is transmitted. It requires both peers to exchange three synchronization and acknowledgment messages before actual data communication begins.

1. **Step 1**: The client sends a synchronization message to the server. The objective of this message is to ask or infer if the server is open for new connections.
2. **Step 2**: When the server receives the synchronization message from the client, it responds and returns a confirmation receipt. The acknowledgment message or SYN ACK message. This acknowledgment indicates that the server correctly acknowledged the client's message in that it is sending its own synchronization to be acknowledged as well.
3. **Step 3**: The client receives the SYN ACK from the server and responds with its own acknowledgment message. Each side must acknowledge the synchronization message of the other side. Upon completion of this process, the connection is created and the client and server can communicate.

## TCP: A Reliable Protocol

TCP is reliable since the protocol ensures that data is not damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order. Otherwise, it must recover it. TCP ensures that all data is fully transmitted and can be assembled by the receiver in the correct order. TCP achieves this reliability by assigning a sequence number to each byte transmitted and requiring a positive acknowledgment from the receiving peer. If the acknowledgment is not received within the timeout interval, the data is re-transmitted. At the receiver, the sequence numbers are used to correct the order of segments that may be received out of order and to eliminate duplicates.

### Example: Sequence and Acknowledgment Numbers

Let's see a small example of how sequence and acknowledgment numbers are used. For this specific example, we will assume that when the session was established, it was agreed that the segment size is 10 bytes, and that the sender can send 30 bytes before expecting to receive an acknowledgment from the receiver.

In our example, the sender sends three segments of 10 bytes each. The sequence for the first segment is zero, representing the first 10 bytes numbered 0-9. The sequence number for the second segment is 10, representing bytes 10 through 19. The sequence number for the third segment is 20, representing bytes 20 through 29. If the first three segments or 30 bytes numbered 0-29 were correctly received within a defined interval, the receiver will send acknowledgment Number 30, indicating it is expecting Byte Number 30 to be received. Now, let's assume that the second segment arrived damaged or got lost. In that case, the receiver would ask for its re-transmission by sending back ACK Number 10, telling the sender it is expecting byte Number 10. This is a very simplified example just to convey the idea of how TCP uses sequence and acknowledgment numbers to provide reliability. Also, we've shown only one side of the communication. But since TCP sessions are bidirectional, data is sent in both directions.

## TCP Flow Control

Another mechanism provided by TCP is flow control. Flow control is a process of managing the rate of data transmission between two nodes to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver. The idea is that the receiver will send feedback to the sender to let it know about its current condition. To control the amount of data that the sender sends, the receiver will advertise its receive Window size, that is the spare room in the receiver buffer, or the number of bytes it is prepared to receive before an acknowledgment is sent. It is important to notice that the Window size is dynamically adjusted, increased or decreased as needed. Once again, we have seen only one side of the communication. But since TCP sessions are bidirectional, data is sent and received in both directions. This means that each side controls its receive Window size independently.

## TCP/IP vs UDP

While TCP provides many mechanisms for reliability, it comes at a cost. TCP consumes more resources, uses more network bandwidth, and results in slower transfers. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP), on the other hand, allows applications to transfer data with minimum protocol overhead. With UDP, data is continuously sent to the recipient, whether it is ready to receive it or not. Re-transmission of lost data is not supported, and packets may arrive out of order. UDP avoids the unnecessary overheads of TCP transport, making it incredibly efficient in terms of bandwidth and less demanding on poor performing networks. Although UDP is not ideal for sending an email, viewing a web page, or downloading a file, it is largely preferred for real-time applications like voice or video.

## Port Numbers in TCP/IP and UDP

One thing that TCP and UDP have in common is that they both use source and destination port numbers to identify the specific process within the local and remote nodes. The destination port is a well-known number identifying the service requested on the remote server. The source port is a dynamically allocated number, identifying the process that sends the data.

## Example: Using Port Numbers

Consider a single server that runs two services, HTTP and FTP. When a client generates a request targeted at that server, the client must specify which service is requested, either HTTP or FTP. In this example, the client generates an HTTP request for a webpage. When this request arrives at the server, it must be able to identify that it is an HTTP request and forward it to the HTTP service. Only the HTTP service can respond to the HTTP request. The request generated by the client, the destination port number is the field that identifies the service requested at the destination node. For HTTP, the well-known port number is 80. It is customary to say that HTTP servers listen to port 80. As you can see in the request generated by the client, a source port is also present. The source port is a dynamically allocated number identifying the process that sends the data since many active concurrent processes are supported. Please note that when the server responds, the destination and source port change places, so the HTTP server responses with source port 80 and the destination port of the sending process. Port numbers are 16-bit in size, hence ranging from 1-65,535, 0 is reserved. Port numbers in the range of 0-1023 are the well-known ports that are used by common TCP/IP applications.

## Internet Layer: IPv4

We are now ready to move on to the Internet layer. IPv4 is a network layer protocol. There is another version of IP known as IPv6, but it is outside the scope of this course. IP provides network services to Layer 4 protocols, such as TCP and UDP, and in return asks Layer 2 protocols to carry the packet over the physical medium. IP is a best effort protocol and hence relies on upper layer protocol mechanisms. As such, it does not include mechanisms for reliability, flow control, and sequencing. Just a reminder, the Internet layer provides the functions necessary to deliver a packet from a source to destination over an interconnected system of networks. While transport layer protocols operate end-to-end, Internet layer protocols operate between any two directly connected layer three nodes. An example, an end node, and it's directly connected router or a router and its neighboring router. In order to fulfill this function, Internet layer protocols should define the following Layer 3 addressing, Layer 3 packet format, routing functionalities, when routing occurs, one router after another or hop-by-hop.

## IP Addressing

In an IP network, every network interface of a node is assigned with an IP address. An IPv4 address is a sequence of 32-bits divided into four groups of 8-bits per group known as octets. For a more readable representation, the four octets are separated with dots and each octet is represented by decimal equivalent, also known as the dotted decimal notation. IP addresses contain two parts. Network address identifies the systems that are located on the same subnet and host address, which identifies a specific host within the subnet. All host in the same subnet share a common subnet address. Every router interface defines an IP subnet. In this example, we have a router with three network interfaces hence three subnets are defined. The network address for all host in subnet A is 192.168.1.0, where the fourth octet represents the host unique address within the subnet.

## Routing in IP Networks

Routing is the process of choosing the best path to reach a destination. A router is a computer that has been dedicated to the task of forwarding IP packets between networks. A router makes forwarding decisions based on its forwarding database called a routing table. The routing table includes entries that map remote IP networks to next hop routers that are identified by local interfaces. Routing occurs one router after another, or hop-by-hop.

This concludes the discussion on TCP/IP protocol suite. We've seen how the application layer protocol formats the message that needs to be carried over the network. The application layer protocol then requests transport services from the transport layer. The transport layer adds a Layer 4 header and requests network services from the network layer. The network layer IP adds a Layer 3 header. Now, the IP packet is ready to be carried over the physical medium. The specifics of that are defined in a network access layer. Even though IP is a medium independent protocol, meaning it can be carried over different media types, the most commonly used one is Ethernet. We'll cover the details of Ethernet in the next unit.
