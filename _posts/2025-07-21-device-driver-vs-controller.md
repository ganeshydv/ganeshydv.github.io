# Device Driver vs Controller

## Device Driver

1. **Software**: Device drivers are software components.
2. **Managed by OS**: The operating system manages device drivers.
3. **Abstraction**: Device drivers are provided by hardware manufacturers to create an abstraction between the hardware and the operating system.

## Controller

1. **Device Specific**: Each device chip has its own controller.
2. **Firmware**: Controllers have their own firmware stored in RAM, which loads and prepares the device for interaction.

DEVICE DRIVER: 
1) Software
2) Manage by OS
3) Given by hardware to provide
  abstraction between hardware and OS

Controller:
1) each device chip has it's own controller
2) Controller has own Firmare in it's RAM
  which load and makes device ready for 
  interaction
