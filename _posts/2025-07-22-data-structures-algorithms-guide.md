## 999. Sort {#section-999}

# Bubble sort : swap each time if max
 ## compare previous and current then swap
   1. while iterting swipe for each time when max [here max between 2 eles and swap]
   2. in end max will be at last position
   3. one or many swaps in one iteration
   4. after each iteration end=end-1

# Selection sort : swap if biggest only one swap
   1. while itreating find max and put at end
   2. only one swap in one iteration
   3. after each iteration end=end-1

## 999. Tips {#section-999}

# EXOR : use for canceling same elements 
  Ex:  when iterating over array need to find ele which is not repeated twice
  arr=[1,1,2,5,4,2,3,3,5,6,6]
  ans: 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 6 = 7
  nums: 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 6
  op = ans ^ nums = 4;
  EX2: 1^1=0 but 1^1^1 =1
    both same then 0 else 1
    1^2=[0-1]^[1-0]=[1-1]=3

# Hash Map : when need to remeber somethig 

# TWO Pointer : when need to compare or need to make only half iterations
