# 📌 Possible Failure Scenarios in Load Testing

## 🔍 Overview
When stress testing an application with JMeter or any load testing tool, various system components can become bottlenecks, leading to performance degradation or failures. Below is a detailed breakdown of common failure scenarios, their causes, and expected system behavior.

## 🚨 Failure Scenarios & Causes

| 🛑 **Scenario**                     | ⚠️ **Cause**                                           | 🔥 **Expected Behavior**                                   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **🖥️ CPU Usage 100%**              | Too many concurrent requests, inefficient code (e.g., blocking operations in Node.js) | Slow response times, increased latency, request timeouts |
| **🛑 Memory Exhausted**            | Too many in-memory objects, unoptimized caching | Application crash, Out of Memory (OOM) errors |
| **🗄️ Database Connection Limits Exceeded** | Too many concurrent DB connections | Errors like `Too many connections`, slow queries |
| **📀 Disk I/O Saturation**         | Large queries, unoptimized database indexes | Increased response latency, potential DB locks |
| **🌐 Network Bandwidth Saturated**  | High traffic with large payload sizes | Requests start failing due to bandwidth exhaustion |

## 📊 How to Identify System Breakdown?

### ✅ Key Metrics to Monitor
- **CPU Utilization** (Above 90% = Performance degradation risk)
- **Memory Usage** (Check swap usage & memory leaks)
- **Database Connections** (Ensure connection pooling is efficient)
- **Disk I/O Read/Write Latency** (High disk operations can slow down the system)
- **Network Throughput** (Track data transfer rate, avoid saturation)

### 🛠️ Tools for Monitoring
- **AWS CloudWatch** (For AWS-based applications)
- **htop, top, free -m** (Linux Performance Monitoring)
- **Grafana + Prometheus** (Real-time visualization)
- **JMeter Listeners** (To track response times, error rates, throughput)

## 🔄 How to Prevent System Failures?

### 📌 **Scaling Strategies**
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** - Add more instances when load increases.
- **Load Balancers (ELB, Nginx, HAProxy)** - Distribute traffic efficiently.
- **Database Read Replicas** - Offload read-heavy workloads.

### 🚀 **Optimization Techniques**
- **Enable Caching (Redis, Memcached)** - Reduce unnecessary DB queries.
- **Optimize Database Queries** - Use indexing, avoid full table scans.
- **Implement Rate Limiting** - Prevent API abuse and traffic spikes.
- **Queueing (SQS, Kafka)** - Process requests asynchronously to manage spikes.

## 🏁 Conclusion
By monitoring key system metrics and simulating **gradual load increments**, you can predict failure points and scale your system **before it crashes**. Always test under real-world conditions to build a resilient and high-performance architecture. 🚀
