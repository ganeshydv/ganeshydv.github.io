# so generally what happens is 
```text
1) device get's IP: device (MAC)---> router ( saves MAC with IP )--> 
DHCP (in router )-->gives new IP to device i.e. Internal IP
2) device to internet site :device( Internal IP + MAC) -->
( Network layer )  packet + Internal IP --> ( Link layer ) Frame ( contains MAC + External IP of router )  router (External IP by ISP) --> ISP --> Site's server
3) Response from Site : server ( ISP IP + External IP of router ) ---> ISP  --> Router ( ARP to find internal IP associated with MAC from Response )--> Device (based on Internal IP associated with MAC )
```

Your breakdown is quite accurate, but I would like to make a few clarifications and corrections:

### Device Obtains IP from DHCP:

- When a device joins a network, it typically sends a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) request to the router.
The DHCP server in the router assigns an internal IP address to the device based on its MAC address.
The router maintains a DHCP lease table that associates MAC addresses with assigned internal IP addresses.
Device Communicates with an External Site:

- When the device sends a packet to an external site, the packet contains the source IP address (the internal IP assigned by DHCP) and the device's MAC address.
The router performs Network Address Translation (NAT), replacing the source IP address with its own external IP address (assigned by the ISP). The MAC address is not changed in this process.
The router creates a frame with the device's MAC address as the source MAC and its own external IP address as the source IP, and it forwards this frame to the ISP.
ISP Routes the Packet to the Destination Site:

- The ISP receives the packet, sees the destination IP address (the external IP of the router), and routes it accordingly to reach the destination site's server.
Response from Site to Device:

- The response from the site's server has a destination IP address set to the external IP address of the router (assigned by the ISP).
- The ISP routes the response packet to the router based on the destination IP.
- he router, using its NAT table, determines the internal IP address associated with the original device's MAC address.
- The router replaces the destination IP address in the packet with the internal IP address and forwards it to the device within the local network.
- Regarding the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), it is typically used within a local network to map an IP address to a MAC address. In the scenario of receiving a response from the internet, the router uses its NAT table to determine the internal IP address associated with the MAC address of the device, and no ARP is involved in this process.

Your understanding of the flow is generally correct, and these processes are fundamental to how devices communicate on a network, especially when dealing with private/internal IP addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) for communication with the internet.

--------------
# So ARP only used in local network while NAT used when communication is with external networks?
-------------------

Yes, that's correct. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and NAT (Network Address Translation) serve different purposes in networking and are typically used in different contexts:

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):

- ARP is used within a local network to map an IP address to a corresponding MAC address.
- When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same local network, it uses ARP to discover the MAC address associated with the IP address.
- ARP requests are broadcast within the local network, and the device with the corresponding IP address responds with its MAC address.
### NAT (Network Address Translation):

- NAT is used when a device within a local network wants to communicate with devices on external networks, such as the internet.
- The router, acting as a NAT device, replaces the source IP address in outgoing packets with its own external IP address. This process allows multiple devices within the local network to share a single external IP address.
- When responses are received from external networks, the router uses its NAT table to determine the internal IP address to which the response should be forwarded.
- In summary, ARP is used for address resolution within a local network, ensuring that devices can communicate with each other using their MAC addresses. NAT, on the other hand, is employed for communication between devices within a local network and external networks, providing a way for multiple devices to share a single external IP address and facilitating communication over the internet.


-------------------
 
## Scenario 1: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) - IN LOCAL Network

#### 1] Device Joins Local Network:

- new device (Device A) joins a local network and requests an IP address from the router through DHCP.
The router, acting as a DHCP server, assigns an internal IP address to Device A.
Device A Communicates with Another Local Device (Device B):

#### 2] Device A wants to communicate with another device (Device B) on the same local network.
- Device A sends an ARP broadcast to discover the MAC address associated with the internal IP address of Device B.
Device B responds to the ARP request, providing its MAC address to Device A.
#### 3] Communication Between Devices A and B:

- Now that Device A knows the MAC address of Device B, it can construct packets addressed to Device B using the Link layer information (MAC addresses).
In this scenario, ARP is crucial for devices within the same local network to discover each other's MAC addresses associated with their IP addresses.


## Scenario 2: NAT (Network Address Translation)

#### 1. Device Sends Packet to External Server:

- Device A, with an internal IP address, initiates communication with an external server on the internet.
The router, using NAT, replaces the source IP address in the packet with its own external IP address.
Communication with the External Server:

- The router forwards the packet to the external server using its external IP address.
The external server responds to the router's external IP address.
#### 2. Router Translates the Response Using NAT:

- When the response packet arrives at the router, NAT is used to determine the internal IP address (Device A) associated with the original communication.
- The router replaces the destination IP address in the response packet with the internal IP address of Device A and forwards it within the local network.
- In this scenario, NAT is employed to allow multiple devices within the local network to share a single external IP address for communication with external servers on the internet.


-------------------
# So when device makes first time connection with router it stores mac with assigned internal ip in NAT table
-------------------


- Yes, that's correct. When a device makes its initial connection to the router, particularly through a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) process, the router maintains a NAT (Network Address Translation) table that associates the device's MAC address with the internal IP address assigned to it.

- Here's a simplified overview of the process:

#### Device Joins the Network:

- A new device connects to the local network, and it may request an IP address from the router through DHCP.
Router Assigns Internal IP:

- The router, acting as a DHCP server, assigns a unique internal IP address to the device based on its MAC address.
NAT Table Entry Created:

- The router creates an entry in its NAT table that associates the MAC address of the device with the internal IP address assigned to it.
Device Communication with External Network:

- When the device communicates with external servers or devices on the internet, the router uses NAT to replace the source IP address in outgoing packets with its own external IP address.
#### Router Forwards Packets and Manages NAT Table:

- The router forwards the packets to the external network, and the NAT table helps keep track of the association between internal IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses.
Handling Responses:

- When responses from the external network arrive at the router, the NAT table is consulted to determine the appropriate internal IP address (and associated MAC address) to forward the response to within the local network.
- In this way, the NAT table helps the router manage the translation between internal and external IP addresses, allowing multiple devices within the local network to share a single external IP address for communication with the external network. The NAT table is dynamic and is continuously updated as devices join or leave the network.
