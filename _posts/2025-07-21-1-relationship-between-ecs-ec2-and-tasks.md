## 1️⃣ Relationship Between ECS, EC2, and Tasks
- ECS Cluster = Group of EC2 instances (if using the EC2 launch type).
- EC2 Instance = A virtual machine inside the ECS cluster that runs multiple ECS tasks (containers) based on available CPU & memory.
- ECS Task = A running container (or multiple containers in a task definition).
- Hierarchy:
  >  `🚀 ECS Cluster (Parent) → 🖥️ EC2 Instances (Workers) → 📦 ECS Tasks (Containers)`

## 2️⃣ How Tasks Are Placed on EC2 Instances?
- When an ECS task starts, ECS checks if any existing EC2 instance has enough CPU & RAM.
- If there is space, the task starts on that instance.
- If no instance has enough resources, the task fails to start (if no auto scaling is enabled).
- If ECS auto scaling is enabled, a new EC2 instance will be launched to fit the new task.
## 3️⃣ What Happens If a Task Fails to Start?
### 🔹 Scenario 1: Enough Resources Available
- ✅ Task is placed on an existing EC2 instance.

### 🔹 Scenario 2: No Space Left on Any EC2 Instance
- ❌ Task fails → EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG) adds a new instance → ECS places the task on the new instance.

### 🔹 Scenario 3: Scaling Down

- If CPU utilization is low for a while, ECS removes some tasks.
- If EC2 instances are underutilized, EC2 Auto Scaling can remove unused instances (if tasks can fit elsewhere).
#
## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- ✅ One ECS Cluster → Can have multiple EC2 instances.
- ✅ One EC2 Instance → Can run multiple ECS Tasks (if it has enough resources).
- ✅ If tasks cannot start due to lack of CPU/RAM, ECS triggers EC2 Auto Scaling to add a new instance.
- ✅ Tasks & instances scale down when CPU usage remains low for a while.
