## ðŸ”‘ Your Question:
If multiple objects share the same ReadWriteLock object, will they be mutually exclusive, even though they are different objects
### âœ… Short Answer:
Yes, if multiple instances share the same ReadWriteLock, their read and write access will be controlled globally â€” across all instances.
## ðŸ’¡ Key Principle
A lock (including ReadWriteLock) controls access to the code block, not the object â€” it doesn't care about the object instance, only about the lock instance

## Example
```java
class SharedResource {
    private final ReadWriteLock lock;

    public SharedResource(ReadWriteLock sharedLock) {
        this.lock = sharedLock;
    }

    public void read(String name) {
        lock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(name + " reading...");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (Exception e) {
        } finally {
            lock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    public void write(String name) {
        lock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(name + " writing...");
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (Exception e) {
        } finally {
            lock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReadWriteLock sharedLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

        SharedResource obj1 = new SharedResource(sharedLock);
        SharedResource obj2 = new SharedResource(sharedLock);

        new Thread(() -> obj1.read("Reader-1")).start();
        new Thread(() -> obj2.read("Reader-2")).start();
        new Thread(() -> obj1.write("Writer-1")).start();
        new Thread(() -> obj2.write("Writer-2")).start();
    }
}
```
### âœ… Result:
- Reader-1 and Reader-2 can run together âœ…
- Writer-1 and Writer-2 will block each other âœ…
- A writer will wait until all readers finish âœ…
- `Even though obj1 and obj2 are different objects, the lock is shared, so access is coordinated`.

## ðŸ”¥ What if Each Object Had Its Own Lock?
```java
SharedResource obj1 = new SharedResource(new ReentrantReadWriteLock());
SharedResource obj2 = new SharedResource(new ReentrantReadWriteLock());
```
Now:
- They have independent locks ðŸ”“
- Readers/writers from obj1 and obj2 won't block each other
- Not thread-safe globally
- This is like having 10 DB servers with independent limits â€” bad idea if you want centralized control (e.g., connection pool of size 5).
