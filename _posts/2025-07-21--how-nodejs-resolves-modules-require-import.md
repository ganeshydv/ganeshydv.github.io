# üõ† How Node.js Resolves Modules (require & import)
Whenever you use require() or import in Node.js, Node follows a specific algorithm to locate the module. Let's break it down step by step:

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Module Resolution Order in Node.js
Node.js looks for a module in the following order:

1. Core Modules (Built-in) ‚Äì e.g., fs, http, path, crypto
1. File Modules (Relative & Absolute Paths) ‚Äì e.g., require('./math.js')
1. Node Modules (Third-party packages from node_modules/)
1. Global Modules (npm link, global installs)

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Node Resolves a require() Call
### 1. Example 1: require("fs") (Core Module)
- ‚úÖ Node immediately finds the core module and loads it.
- ‚è≥ No file system lookup required.
### 2. Example 2: require("./math.js") (Relative Path)
```js
const math = require("./math.js");
```
### üìå Resolution Process:
1. Checks if math.js exists in the current folder (./math.js).
1. Wraps it in a function & executes.

### Example 3: require("express") (Third-party Module)
### üìå Resolution Process:
1. Looks inside the current project's node_modules/express/.
   1. Checks: ./node_modules/express/index.js
   1. Checks: ./node_modules/express/package.json ("main" field)
1. If not found, moves up the directory tree (../node_modules/).
1. Continues until it finds the module or reaches the root (/node_modules).
1. Throws an error if the module is not found:
```js
Error: Cannot find module 'express'
```
### üõ† Why does Node search in parent directories?

- This allows dependencies to be installed only once at the root.
- Useful for monorepos and large projects.
# 3Ô∏è‚É£ How Node Resolves Index Files & Folders
Example: Importing a Directory
If you require() a folder, Node tries these in order:

1. Looks for package.json and "main" entry
1. Looks for index.js
1. Looks for index.json
1. Looks for index.node (C++ Addons)
# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Absolute vs. Relative Paths in require()
# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Module Paths (NODE_PATH)
By default, Node only searches node_modules/. But you can add custom paths using the NODE_PATH environment variable.

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ ES Modules (import) Resolution in Node.js
ES Modules (import/export) use different resolution rules.
### üìå ESM Rules
1. Requires file extensions (.js, .mjs) (No implicit resolution like CJS).
1. Cannot use require() inside ES Modules.
1. Relative paths (./, ../) are mandatory.
