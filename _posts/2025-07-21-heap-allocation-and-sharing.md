# Heap Allocation and Sharing

The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. It is allocated separately for each process and shared among all threads within the process.

## Heap Allocation for Processes

Each process has its own heap. When a process is created, the operating system allocates a portion of memory for the process's heap. Memory allocated from the heap is managed by the process's memory allocator, such as `malloc()` and `free()` in C, or the equivalent memory management functions in other programming languages. Processes do not share their heap with other processes; each process has its own separate heap.

## Heap Sharing Among Threads

Within a process, all threads share the same heap. This means that memory allocated from the heap by one thread can be accessed and modified by other threads within the same process. Because threads share the same memory space, they can access global variables and dynamically allocated memory (heap) without any special synchronization mechanisms. However, care must be taken to properly synchronize access to shared data to avoid race conditions and other concurrency issues.

# Execution Context

The execution context represents the state of a process or thread at a given point in time during its execution. It is managed by the operating system and is saved/restored during context switches between processes or threads.

## Components of Execution Context

The execution context includes the following components:

- **Program Counter (PC)**: This holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- **CPU Registers**: These hold the current working variables of the processor.
- **Stack Pointer (SP)**: This points to the top of the stack.
- **Heap Pointer (HP)**: This points to the start of the heap.
- Other CPU-specific state information.

## Execution Context in Processes and Threads

- **Processes**: Each process has a different execution context.
- **Threads**: Each thread has a different execution context.

## Heap and Stack in Execution Context

Both the heap and the stack are part of the execution context of a process or thread. This means that they are included in the saved state during a context switch and restored when the process or thread is resumed.

=======================================
 ### How Heap is allocated - only allocated to Process
=======================================
Yes, the heap is typically allocated separately for
each process, and within each process, 
it is shared among all threads. Let's clarify this further:
[ only allocated to Process and shared between all
 threads means it is common for all threads ]

Heap Allocation for Processes:

Each process has its own heap, which is a 
region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
When a process is created, the operating system 
allocates a portion of memory for the process's heap.
Memory allocated from the heap is managed by 
the process's memory allocator, such as malloc() 
and free() in C, or the equivalent memory 
management functions in other programming languages.
Processes do not share their heap with other 
processes; each process has its own separate heap.

Heap Sharing Among Threads:

Within a process, all threads share the same heap. 
This means that memory allocated from the heap by 
one thread can be accessed and modified by other 
threads within the same process.
Because threads share the same memory space, 
they can access global variables and dynamically 
allocated memory (heap) without any special 
synchronization mechanisms.
However, care must be taken to properly 
synchronize access to shared data to avoid race conditions 
and other concurrency issues.

###   Execution Context 
====================================

Execution Context:

1) The execution context represents the state of a process 
or thread at a given point in time during its execution.
2) It includes information such as the 
  - program counter (PC), 
  - CPU registers, 
  - stack pointer (SP) - STACK , 
  - heap pointer (HP) - HEAP, 
  - and other CPU-specific state.
3) The execution context is managed by the operating system 
and is saved/restored during context switches between 
processes or threads.

a] for Process :
 - have different execution context
b] for Thread :
 - have different execution context

IMP) Heap and Stack in Execution Context:
Both the heap and the stack are part of the execution context of a process or thread
