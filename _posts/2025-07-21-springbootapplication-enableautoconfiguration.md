# @SpringBootApplication = @EnableAutoConfiguration + @ComponentScan + @Configuration

## @EnableAutoConfiguration
- Scans package based on class path and registers BEANs in Application Context
- Spring Boot considers the package of the class declaring
the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` as the default package. Therefore, if we apply this
annotation in the root package of the application, every sub-packages & classes will
be scanned. As a result, we wonâ€™t need to explicitly declare the package names
using `@ComponentScan`.
