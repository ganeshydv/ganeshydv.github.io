# Process Life Cycle

The life cycle of a process includes the following stages:

1. **New**: The process is being created. The operating system allocates resources for the process, including memory, CPU time, and other system resources.
2. **Ready**: The process is complete and ready to execute.
3. **Running**: The process is currently executing in memory.
4. **Waiting**: The process is waiting for I/O or due to an interrupt.
5. **Terminated**: The process has finished execution and all allocated resources are freed.

Different OS modules, such as the scheduler dispatcher, manage the transition of a process from one stage to another.

## Context Switching

If the scheduler decides to switch to another process or if the current process enters a blocked state (e.g., waiting for I/O), a context switch occurs. During a context switch, the CPU saves the current process's execution state (registers, program counter, etc.) back to memory before loading the state of the next process to execute.

# Process State Queues

1. **Job Queue**: Queue for new processes.
2. **Ready Queue**: Queue for ready processes. The degree of multi-programming determines how many processes can stay in the Ready Queue at a time. The ready queue is typically implemented as a data structure in memory, such as a priority queue or a FIFO queue.
3. **Waiting Queue**: Queue for processes that are waiting for some operation to complete.

# Transition Between States

1. **Job Scheduler/Long-Term Scheduler**: Moves jobs from the New state to the Ready state. Transfers jobs from the Job Queue to the Ready Queue.
2. **CPU Scheduler/Short-Term Scheduler**: Moves jobs from the Ready state to the Running state. Dispatches jobs to the CPU.
3. For other states, different components may be responsible for the transition, such as the scheduler, I/O subsystem, and process management facilities.

## -------------------------------------------
## Process Life cycle : 

1) New : creating process [IN_Disk]
    - the operating system allocates resources for 
    the process, including memory, CPU time, and 
    other system resources then it's called new
2) Ready : Process complete and ready to execute [in_RAM]
3) Runnig : Process is executing on memory [in_RAM]
4) Waiting : waiting for IO or beacause of Interrupt [in_RAM]
5) Terminated : Process finished and all RAM being Free 
    [Removed_all_allocated_resources]

[ 
    There are different OS modules which makes Process 
    go from one stage to another EX. schedule Dispatcher
    it give control of cpu to process from ready to running
]
# Context Switching: 
If the scheduler decides to switch to another 
process or if the current process enters a blocked 
state (e.g., waiting for I/O), a context switch occurs. 
During a context switch, the CPU saves the current 
process's execution state (registers, program counter, 
etc.) back to memory before loading the state of the 
next process to execute
-------------------------------------------
## Process State Queues :
 -
1) Job Queue : NEW process queue. [IN_RAM]
2) Ready Queue : Ready Proocess [IN_RAM]
  - Degree Of multi-programming : how many processes
    can stay in Ready Queue at a time
- The ready queue is typically implemented as 
a data structure in memory, such as a priority 
queue or a FIFO queue
3) waiting Queue

------------------------------------------------
## How Process goes from one state to another ?
------------------------------------------------
1) Job scheduler/ Long_Term Schedular : 
- Moves Jobs from NEW to Ready state
  [ Program from DISK to RAM ]
- Jobs from Job Queue -> to Ready Queue
2) CPU shcedular/ Short_Term Schedular :
- Moves Jobs from Ready state to Running 
 [ Dispateches Jobs to CPU done by Schedular Dispatcher ]
3) for other states:
- there may be different component responsible for transition
the scheduler, I/O subsystem, and process management facilities.etc
