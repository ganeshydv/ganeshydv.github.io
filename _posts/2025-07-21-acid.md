## ACID
- Transaction = Query
### 1. Automicity: All or nothing
- If one Transaction is running 2 or more queries then if later any query fails it should rollback so there is No transaction
### 2. Consistency: before and after transaction (Query) data should be consistent
- If table has constraints or updating one table should lead to change in another then this process should be complete else inconsistent data will be generated.
### 3. Isolation:  One Row can be accessed by only one transaction at a time.
- If 2 transactions wants to access same row or waiting to acess one row after another but that row is being locked by another transaction this will create `DEADLOCK`.
- 
### 4. Durability: After Commit if DB fails still after restart data should be recovered
