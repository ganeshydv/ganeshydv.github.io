=====================================================
authentication can be : 
1] stateless : if no session is stored in server
  Ex. if only jwt is verified for authentication
2] statefull : if session is stored in backend
 Ex. with every request cookies are sent which 
   contains session data and this session has Id
   i.e. sessionID using this user is validated and
   identified and his history is taken from session

=========================================================
--------- session ---------


--------- cookies ---------
-cookie is header just  like authorization or content-type
- Set-Header 
- signed with secret 
- can be encrypted
- url encoded : not for security but compat
- conatins sessionID token
- attributes : 1) Domain 2) Path 3) Expiration
-flags : 1) HttpOnly(can not read with js on browser) '
         2) secure(HTTPS only i.e only can be sent on TLS channel)
         3) SameSite (no CORS)

- CSRF Attack : Croos-site Resource Forgery

=====================================================
why access token and refresh token?
-> let say there is microservice which handles payments
 if user needs to access so critical info then user needs
 to send a access token to this service 
- now who generates this access token ? this token ie. 
 access token as well as refresh token both are generated 
 by same service or server ex. api gateway or auth server
- now the thing is thei access token only be used in 
 payments service and this service should only can decrypt 
 this access token it means auth server and payments service
 both should have same secret 
- and it expires in minimum time
- if when user again want to access these critical data
it should send this access token if inavalid 
auth server regenerates this access token if and only if
there is refresh token 
- in this way instead of using only one token to access critical
data two different tokens are used so the payments service
become secure because token gets inavalid in some time
- remeber payments service only decrypt it and
 auth server it generates it but for generating it requires
 refresh token.

=====================================================
Id token: used by service to communicate with 3rd party service
Access token: used by service to access another service
Refresh token : used by service to get Access token and used
    with service

======================================================
1) access token :
               -issued when client/user wants to access secure data 
                ex. profiles updates,password changes ,payments,etc
               -used for secure API calls
               -access token tells server that client is authorized 
                to make the request on secure routes/ APIs
               - short life time
               - IMP : access tokens are transfered in URI fragment 
                so when using 3rd party authentication
                 it will expose this token to unauthorized 3rd party 
                 application as well so use
                 PKFCE 

2) Refresh token :
               - access token expires then use refresh token to get 
                new access token in this way user 
                does not need to login again until refresh token 
                expires
                - long life token
                - use ProofKeyCodeExchange (PKFCE) with refresh token
                - how to secure? 
                 1) Refresh token rotation : Always return refresh token 
                 as well with access token 
                 2) server stores these refresh tokens
                 3) when 2nd request is made it verifies refresh token 
                 if the token is the last one
                 it issues new access token as well refrsh token but 
                 if the token is not the last but
                 older one (checks it by finding in db) then server 
                 logs out user as there might be a
                 chance that user is not valid or legit - some one else 
                 is using it. 
                   -- agar user ko sirf ed device me login permission 
                   deni ho tab 
                 1) Refresh token rotation use karna 
                 -- hamesh request k object me referred URL ata hai to 
                 isse agar db me save kar k 
                 rakhenge to ye bhi verify kar sakte hai ki user same 
                 hi hai ya nhi 

3) Id token : used to take identity of user from 3rd party application
    ex. google,fb 
              and  use these details to build profile of that user in 
              our application
            - OpenID connect : it is used by authServer (Ex of google,fb ) 
            for authentication 
                  which issues idTOken to client (ex. our application )
                  when user logs In
